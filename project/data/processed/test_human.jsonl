A spokesman added that the paperwork theft was reported to the information commissioner for Scotland. In 2012/13, equipment was stolen from a special operations response division vehicle, while ambulances at the Scottish Ambulance Service academy in Glasgow were also targeted. Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: \"The idea of thieves targeting ambulances while paramedics attempt to save lives is sickening. \"People will be disgusted that this has occurred so many times across Scotland over the last three years. \"There may well be questions for the ambulance service about security of vehicles, but paramedics can hardly be expected to worry about break-ins while patients' lives are at risk.\" He added: \"Clearly the contents of ambulances make for appealing rummaging among some crooks. \"But anyone caught thieving from these vehicles is the lowest of the low, and must be treated as such by the law if and when they are caught.\" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: \"As the front line of NHS services in Scotland, our Ambulance Service respond to 700,000 calls per year, around 500,000 of which receive an emergency response. \"Delivering patient care is the absolute priority of ambulance crews and it is despicable that mindless thieves capitalise on these situations to steal equipment. Not only is the equipment on board vital to the ambulance crews but it could also be potentially dangerous in the wrong hands.\""}
{"text": "In matches played up until 1 October this season, Welsh players accounted for 2.45% of total minutes in England's top division, State of the Game found. This represents a slight fall from a last season's figure of 3.12%. However a rise in the number of Argentines in the top flight saw Wales slip from eighth to ninth top country for total minutes played. There were 13 Welsh players who got on the field in the Premier League in the period covered by the study. However the number of Argentines increased from 12 last season to 18 as they leapt from 10th to fifth overall. England, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, France, Spain, Belgium and the Netherlands were the other nations ahead of Wales. State of the Game analysed the total minutes played by each nationality in the Premier League, Championship and Scottish Premiership to 1 October this season and in 2013-14. Click here to read all the Premier League data from the State of the Game study Swansea City, Wales' only Premier League club following the relegation of Cardiff City last season, used the most Welsh players. The Swans fielded three players from their homeland in the period studied and were the only team, along with Crystal Palace (two), to field more than one Welsh player. Others to include a Welshman in the first six matches of the campaign were Arsenal, Hull City, Leicester City, Liverpool, Newcastle United, Southampton, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United. However, less than a quarter of the 13 Welsh players used (three) featured in every game. That overall figure of 13 is only one down from the same period for last season but represents a decline in the amount of actual time spent on the field. Compared with 3,757 minutes at the same stage in 2013-14, Welsh players had completed 2,907 minutes in the top flight. In the Championship, Welsh players had a slightly larger percentage of total minutes than last season, up from 3.8% to 3.91%. A total of 24 Welsh players were used in the Championship. Reading, Charlton Athletic and Wolverhampton Wanderers each used three while Cardiff used one, Declan John, who had played for 45 minutes. In the Scottish Premiership, Welsh players went from 1.09% to 0.92% of total playing time."}
{"text": "Leighton Andrews has rejoined the cabinet as minister for public service, 15 months after he resigned. He will be responsible for delivering local government changes in a newly created post. Jeff Cuthbert and John Griffiths both leave the cabinet. Housing Minister Carl Sargeant moves to natural resources and Lesley Griffiths to communities and tackling poverty. Mr Andrews said he was \"pleased\" to be rejoining the cabinet. Speculation about his return intensified after he was seen leaving Welsh government offices at lunchtime. Mr Andrews resigned as education minister in June 2013 following a row over his defence of a school in his Rhondda constituency which faced closure under his own surplus places policy. His new job will be to deliver major changes in the landscape of local government, with the Williams Commission recommending mergers between councils and a reduction in number from 22 to 10 or 12. Of the two cabinet departures, John Griffiths had been a minister since 2011. Mr Sargeant takes over his natural resources brief while his culture and sport work will be carried out by a deputy minister. Mr Jones said Mr Griffiths had \"made his mark\" in a number of Welsh government roles, notably as Counsel General and \"delivering the pioneering Active Travel Bill\". Jeff Cuthbert is standing down as communities minister, ahead of his decision not to stand for re-election as Caerphilly AM in 2016. He said he was \"sad to go but grateful for a chance to serve\". The first minister said: \"Jeff did great work on tackling poverty, shaping the Future Generations Bill and mitigating worst effects of welfare reform\". Mark Drakeford, Jane Hutt, Edwina Hart and Huw Lewis are all staying in their jobs, while Janice Gregory retains her role as chief whip. Analysis by Tomos Livingstone, BBC Wales political correspondent All eyes might be on Scotland, but in Cardiff Bay at least politics is going on as normal. This was a major reshuffle with one main objective - bring back one of Welsh Labour's big beasts to the front line, and send a signal to local councils that the Welsh government is serious about forcing them to merge. So Leighton Andrews, the man who ran Carwyn Jones's leadership campaign in 2009 is back.  His misdemeanour 18 months ago - campaigning to keep a school open in his own constituency against his own guidelines as Education Minister - is forgiven, if not forgotten.  He now has a new job title - Minister for Public Service Reform - and licence to force through those changes to local government. It won't be easy - many council leaders aren't exactly overjoyed at the prospect of mergers.  But as education minister he had a reputation for bashing heads together and making it very clear if things weren't to his liking.  This is going to be a bumpy ride. Elsewhere there's continuity, with Edwina Hart, Huw Lewis and Mark Drakeford staying in post.  Jeff Cuthbert and John Griffiths are leaving the cabinet, and Mr Cuthbert's old job, Culture Minister, has been downgraded to a deputy minister job.  Gwenda Thomas is also leaving after lengthy services as deputy health and social services minister. This wasn't a chance to bring in new faces and freshen up the cabinet - it was a reboot to make sure everyone's clear about the Welsh government's priority over the coming weeks and months. The reshuffle announcement came on Twitter at 13:00 BST. The news also came as a surprise to cabinet members ahead of a return to Cardiff Bay after the summer recess for assembly members on Monday. The previous change, an enforced one, was in July when Alun Davies was sacked as natural resources minister for pressurising civil servants for private information on opposition AMs. His responsibilities were split between Mrs Hart, Deputy Agriculture Minister Rebecca Evans and Mr Griffiths. The last proper reshuffle was in March 2013. The Welsh Conservatives responded to Thursday's developments by saying the last reshuffle \"was a botched sticking plaster following the sacking of Alun Davies\".

{"text": "They call Ushuaia, a cold and windy port city in Argentina, the end of the world. It's from here that the largest ever all-female expedition to Antarctica will depart, with more than 70 women with backgrounds in science set to spend 20 days at sea. The voyage is part of the Homeward Bound initiative, an Australian programme aimed at increasing the representation of women in top science jobs across the globe. \"We're missing half the voice at the leadership table,\" says Dr Jessica Melbourne-Thomas, who along with entrepreneur and management expert Fabian Dattner, came up with the idea. The pair met during a leadership development course run by Dattner, and their frustration at the challenges faced by women in science quickly became a bold idea. Two years later, the first of what is hoped to be several voyages is about to depart. \"For various reasons it can be difficult for women to get to Antarctica or the Arctic,\" Dr Melbourne-Thomas, an expert in Antarctic ecological modelling, says. \"Homeward Bound came out of discussions around that â€¦ and the lack of representation of women in science. \"It's been two years and a hell of a lot of work, but support from many different angles and Fabian's company Dattner Grant have played a very central role.\" The 76 women who are taking part were selected from a pool of more than 1000 applicants, and will be given a chance to observe the effect climate change is having on Antarctica first-hand. There will also be a series of lectures, leadership workshops and networking opportunities while they are at sea. The importance of emotional intelligence, managing difficult conversations and influencing decisions are among the topics that will be covered as part of the leadership program, on top of lectures covering various aspects of Antarctic science. A \"faculty\" of experts will be on board to administer the programme. Dr Melbourne-Thomas says it is important that more women enter leadership roles as, particularly in the developing world, they stand to lose the most from climate change. She believes many women are shut out because of the choices they need to make to balance families and the demands of senior roles, as well as a lack of role models. \"I've started thinking about Homeward Bound as one part of a wave of initiatives that together might mean we are able to move forward, rather than seeing this very slow rate of change,\" she says. The expedition is privately funded, and each of the participants is paying for their own travel and accommodation on the boat. Dr Melbourne-Thomas originally hoped the voyage would depart from Australian's Tasmania state, where the programme originated, but it wasn't possible without government funding. \"We turned to other options and now the voyage is leaving from South America,\" she says. \"They're much bigger vessels that operate out of South America. \"The Antarctic peninsula is the main tourist route â€” though this certainly is not a tourist voyage.\" Applications for the next expedition, planned for 2018, will be open from January next year."}
{"text": "The High Court in London ordered Associated Newspapers to pay the damages after Weller complained. Seven paparazzi photos were published in October 2012 under the headline \"A family day out: Paul Weller takes wife Hannah and his twin sons out for a spot of shopping in the hot LA sun\". The couple said the shots were \"plainly voyeuristic\". They sued Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and Metro, for misuse of private information on behalf of their daughter Dylan, who was 16 when the pictures appeared online, and twin sons John-Paul and Bowie, who were 10 months old. The one-time frontman of The Jam and the Style Council was not at London's High Court to hear the ruling by Mr Justice Dingemans. A paparazzo had followed the family on a shopping trip in Santa Monica, California, and took photographs without their consent despite being asked to stop. David Sherborne, lawyer for the Weller family, said Hannah Weller - the mother of the twins - had not been in the public eye before her marriage and had taken active steps to prevent their faces being seen in the media. Photos taken in the street, and not in circumstances such as premieres or for promotion, were a \"blatant impediment to the natural social progress of children\", he said. In court, Associated Newspapers argued the images, in which the children's faces were not pixellated, were entirely innocuous and inoffensive and the Wellers had previously chosen to open up their private family life to public gaze to a significant degree. Following Wednesday's ruling, the organisation said it planned to appeal. \"The photographs showed nothing more than Paul Weller and three of his children out and about in public places,\" said a spokesman. \"There was no claim and no finding that we had followed, harassed or targeted Mr Weller or his children and no request had ever been made to pixellate the children's faces. \"Our publication of the images was entirely in line with the law in California where they were taken by a freelance photographer. \"The suggestion that children have an expectation of privacy in relation to publication by the media of images of their faces when one child (now nearly 18) has modelled for Teen Vogue, images of the babies' naked bottoms have been tweeted by their mother, and their father has discussed the children in promotional interviews is a worrying development in our law, as it has conferred unfettered image rights on all the children. \"This judgment has wide-ranging and serious consequences not only for local, national and international digital journalism but for anyone posting pictures of children on social networks. We intend to appeal.\" The judge agreed the images could have been published legally in California, but said their appearance in the UK violated the right to privacy enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. \"There was no relevant debate of public interest to which the publication of the photographs contributed. The balance of the general interest of having a vigorous and flourishing newspaper industry does not outweigh the interests of the children in this case,\" he added. Weller recently announced a new greatest hits collection, More Modern Classics, featuring songs from the last 15 years of his solo career, including From The Floorboards Up, That Dangerous Age and new single Brand New Toy."}

{"text": "Disability campaign groups and members of direct action organisation UK Uncut chanted, held banners and banged drums in the middle of Oxford Circus. Campaigners say the changes in the Welfare Reform Bill would see half a million people lose their benefits. The government said it wanted a simpler and fairer welfare system. The proposals, which are due to come into force in 2013, include introducing a single universal credit. The bill, currently going through Parliament, also includes a cap on benefits to about £500 a week, or £26,000 a year - the level of the average salary of working families. Last week the government was defeated in the Lords on that and other aspects. The Disability Living Allowance would be replaced with a new allowance, Personal Independence Payments. This would involve upfront medical tests and regular assessments for working people aged 16 to 64. UK Uncut said 15 wheelchair users chained themselves together in Oxford Circus at about 12:00 GMT, blocking traffic in part of Regent Street until about 14:30. They were supported by about 250 people, a spokeswoman said. Q&A: Welfare changes row One of the wheelchair users, referring to himself only as Andy, said the changes could be \"devastating\" for disabled people. The 37-year-old, from Islington, north London, said: \"The whole raft of cuts that are being carried through will affect all of the services that support disabled people - public services, social care, the voluntary sector - all these are being cut and disabled people disproportionately depend on these services. \"To reform one would have a big impact, but reforming them all is going to be devastating for those who depend on them.\" Rosemary Willis, from Disabled People Against Cuts, added: \"Maria Miller, so-called minister for disabled people, has repeatedly stated that we are 'financially unsustainable' and we want to ask this government exactly what they mean by that. \"We will not let this government push through these changes which have already led to disabled people taking their own lives.\" Josie McDermot of UK Uncut said the bill was \"cruel and unnecessary\" and added that the protest was an \"essential way to persuade the government to scrap their plans\". A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said the government was \"absolutely committed\" to supporting disabled people and it was spending more than £40bn per year on disabled people. \"Households where someone receives disability living allowance will be exempt from the benefit cap and we are giving local authorities an additional £190m over four years to ensure vulnerable people are supported through the housing benefit reform, so we are not expecting people to become homeless,\" he said. \"The introduction of the universal credit from 2013 will see a simpler and fairer system of support for disabled people.\" He added disabled people in greatest need would receive more support than they do currently. Other changes in the bill include an under-occupancy penalty for council and housing association tenants with spare bedrooms, means-testing the Employment and Support Allowance (which replaced incapacity benefit) after 12 months and charging single parents to use the Child Support Agency."}
{"text": "Cora-Lynn Kelley-Mattock, of Aberporth, Ceredigion, was two when her mother, Josephine, 19, accidentally crashed her Volkswagen Polo in Llandygwydd in 2013. Details of her claim have emerged in a High Court writ. Miss Kelley's insurers say her claimed negligence is not admitted. She died from brain injuries three days after the accident on Boxing Day in 2013, on the A484. Her daughter, now four, suffered severe traumatic head injuries in the crash and has been left with serious disabilities, her barrister James Bell said in the writ. Her lawyers claim Miss Kelley was negligent in crashing the car and may also have failed to strap her into her baby seat properly. Mr Bell said the car was approaching the entrance to the Llwyndryrys residential home, near Cenarth, Carmarthenshire, when it left the road. He said it travelled along the grass verge and \"collided heavily sideways with a dry stone wall\". The toddler suffered a severe head injury, as well as internal injuries and damage to one eye. The writ claimed her mother \"failed to heed slow warnings\" and \"drove too fast\" in damp conditions. She also \"failed to ensure that at all times her daughter was properly restrained and safely secured in her car seat,\" the document added. \"The deceased thereby exposed her daughter to an unnecessary and foreseeable risk of injury,\" it said. Ceredigion Coroner Peter Brunton issued a verdict of death by misadventure in the case of Miss Kelley at Aberystwyth County Court, in June 2014. The coroner said she might have been distracted by her daughter or been trying to avoid another vehicle when she crashed. In their defence to the action, Glyn Edwards, for Miss Kelley's estate and motor insurers, said the basic facts of the crash was not disputed. However, he said negligence on the part of Miss Kelley, either in causing the crash or in not strapping in her daughter properly, was not admitted. He said Cora-Lynn's lawyers are \"required to prove that her mother's negligence was the likely cause of the accident as alleged.\" They must also prove there was not a defect in the car seat which caused it to malfunction. The extent of Cora-Lynn's disabilities and the value of her compensation claim are also in dispute. The contents of the writ and the defence have yet to be tested in evidence before a judge."}

A former Welsh Government adviser said persuading two-thirds of AMs to vote for an increase may not be easy. There are currently 60 AMs, but with more powers soon to be devolved to Wales there have long been calls for that number to be increased. Last week the Wales Act 2017 was given Royal Assent paving the way for the next stage of devolution, including a degree of control over income tax. Provisions in the act will allow the assembly to expand, if two-thirds of AMs agree. Speaking to BBC Wales' Sunday Politics programme, Ms Jones said: \"It's always difficult to make the case in any country in the world that there should be more politicians, but democratic systems require elected members. \"We have to remind ourselves always of the fact that the National Assembly is taking on more powers, and that means current assembly members and assembly members in the future will be very stretched in their workload.\" She said: \"People when they're stretched in their workloads don't do their work as effectively as they could. \"We need to make sure our democratic system in Wales is working at its most effective and we do that for the benefit of the people of Wales.\" The presiding officer has asked the expert panel to report back in the autumn so the assembly can discuss the findings and make any changes before the next election in 2021. Under the Wales Act, the legislation would require a two-thirds majority in the assembly which means ultimately the Labour group would have to back the proposals. But former special advisor Cathy Owens, now a political consultant, told the programme: \"I don't for one minute doubt that quite a lot of the Labour AMs would like there to be more AMs, but that doesn't necessarily mean that getting two thirds of the Assembly to vote for more AMs is going to be an easy thing. \"It's quite difficult for the Labour party at this time, given everything that's happening in the world, to say 'what we want to do now is increase the number of assembly members'. \"Let's not assume this is definitely going to happen. \"A huge amount of work is going to have to go into persuading people this is a good thing to do, to vote for more AMs.\" In an interview with The Wales Report last week, the First Minister Carwyn Jones said the current arrangement works but is \"under strain\". The Welsh Labour leader said he did not want, within weeks of getting the powers, to say \"the first thing we're going to do is increase the number of politicians\", arguing that would \"make us look ridiculous\".

Real Madrid, bidding for their first La Liga title since 2012, are top of the pile at Christmas. They are three points clear of Barcelona, having played a game fewer because of their involvement in the Fifa Club World Cup. Their extra-time win over Kashima Antlers in the final of that tournament means they enter 2017 on the back of 37 games unbeaten in all competitions. Barca have not been having the best season, losing two of their first 16 league games, as well as drawing against third-tier Hercules in the Spanish Cup first leg. But Luis Enrique's side swatted away their opponents in the second leg with a 7-0 victory (8-1 on aggregate) to reach the last 16 of the competition. Even summer signing Paco Alcacer, without a goal in his previous 11 games, managed to get on the scoresheet. Sevilla are still in title contention too, sitting another point behind Barca. Atletico Madrid, Champions League finalists in two of the past three seasons, have not been meeting expectations. They sit in sixth, nine points off top spot. Gary Neville's former side Valencia, who have only spent one season below the top flight since 1931, are only outside the relegation zone on goal difference. There is a usual feel at the top of the top scorers chart, with Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi (12 each) leading the way from Cristiano Ronaldo and... Iago Aspas (10 each). What could change by the time La Liga returns on 6 January? Barcelona are interested in 34-year-old Croatia right-back Darijo Srna, who plays for Shakhtar Donetsk, as competition for Sergi Roberto. Real and Atletico Madrid are both unable to sign anyone in January because of a transfer ban. Valencia boss Cesare Prandelli wants to sign four players and says \"every player at Valencia is liable for a move away\". Bayern Munich may be top of the Bundesliga by three points but there is a new feel to the title race this season. RB Leipzig, who are only in their eighth season, led the way after going unbeaten in their opening 13 games, before slipping up and being pegged back. The controversial club, backed by Red Bull, started in the regionalised fifth tier in 2009 and have been promoted in more seasons than not. But in the last round of games before the Christmas break, champions Bayern taught challengers Leipzig a lesson with a 3-0 victory at the Allianz Arena. Thiago, Xabi Alonso and Robert Lewandowski the goalscorers in the first half, with Leipzig winger Emil Forsberg sent off for the visitors. Several teams are battling for the Champions League places, with Hertha Berlin in third place and Eintracht Frankfurt fourth. Fifth-placed Hoffenheim, are one of only two unbeaten teams in Europe's top four leagues, alongside Real Madrid, but they have drawn more games (10) than they have won (six). Borussia Dortmund, generally Bayern's nearest rivals, find themselves down in sixth position, although they do have Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, the division's top scorer with 16. Cologne striker Anthony Modeste (13), who once played for Blackburn, is second, while Bayern's Lewandowski, who almost signed for Rovers, is in third with 12. Hamburg, the only team to play in every season of the Bundesliga since the league's 1963 formation, are battling for survival and sit in the relegation play-off place. What could change by the time the Bundesliga returns on 20 January? Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund have said they do not plan to sign anyone in January, but RB Leipzig have been linked with Celtic striker Moussa Dembele and Udinese midfielder Seko Fofana, who played together at Fulham. There are plenty of rumours about Wolfsburg boss Valerien Ismael, whose side are in a relegation battle, with Huddersfield manager David Wagner already turning down the chance to replace him. Borussia Monchengladbach boss Andre Schubert left the club after losing their final game of the year to Ismael's Wolfsburg, with Dieter Hecking coming in to replace him. Juventus, who are aiming to win an unprecedented sixth consecutive Serie A title, top the pile again after beating second-placed Roma 1-0 on Saturday. Roma, whose club legend Francesco Totti could retire at the end of the season, are four points behind Juve, having played a game more. The next four teams - Napoli, Lazio, AC Milan and Atalanta are only separated by three points. AC Milan, under Vincenzo Montella this season, are bidding to end their three-year absence from European competition and sit fifth. Their city rivals Inter, on their third manager since the start of August, are seventh, a place above on-loan Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart's Torino. The battle for the golden boot is a close one. Inter captain Mauro Icardi, who fell out with the club's ultras earlier this season, leads the way on 14 goals ahead of Roma striker Edin Dzeko and Torino's Andrea Belotti, who are both on 13. Gonzalo Higuain, who scored a record 36 goals in the league last season, has netted 10 times in Serie A since his £75m summer move from Napoli to Juventus. What could change by the time Serie A returns on 7 January? Juventus want to sign Zenit St Petersburg midfielder Axel Witsel in January. They have also been linked to Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic. AC Milan and Inter have been strongly linked with a move for Manchester United midfielder Marouane Fellaini next month. Fiorentina manager Paulo Sousa is under pressure, with the club sitting in mid-table. Paris St-Germain have won the past four Ligue 1 titles, including last season's record-breaking 31-point winning margin. However, after sacking Laurent Blanc and replacing him with Unai Emery this summer, they are no longer dominating French football. They are in third place, five points behind leaders Nice, with Monaco also above them. Edinson Cavani is making the most of being the main man at PSG since Zlatan Ibrahimovic's departure, and looks like he might run away with the golden boot. His 18 strikes put him five clear of Lyon's Alexandre Lacazette. Premier League rejects Radamel Falcao (11, a goal every 69 minutes for Monaco) and Nice striker Mario Balotelli (eight, a goal every 88 minutes) are having a great time on the Cote d'Azur. What could change by the time Ligue 1 returns on 13 January? There are reports that Paris St-Germain boss Unai Emery could face the sack after six months and be replaced by former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. PSG are thought to be close to signing 23-year-old Wolfsburg winger Julian Draxler, who was a target for Arsenal, and have also been linked with Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez. In Portugal, Benfica, FC Porto and Sporting Lisbon are known as 'The Big Three', having won 81 of the 83 Portuguese titles between them. That is unlikely to change this season, as Benfica lead the way, four points ahead of Porto. Feyenoord, managed by Giovanni van Bronckhorst, have not won the Dutch league this millennium, but they top the table by five points from Ajax. PSV Eindhoven, who have won the past two Eredivisies, are three points further back. Austria could see new champions this season. Cashpoint SC Rheindorf Altach, so called because of a sponsor, have never won the Austrian title, but lead also-sponsored Red Bull Salzburg by two points. They will be top until at least 11 February thanks to a long winter break."}
{"text": "A total of 51 assembly members (MLAs) voted against the Sinn Féin motion, while 43 MLAs voted in favour. It is the third time in the past 18 months that Stormont has rejected same-sex marriage. Northern Ireland is now the only part of the UK which has not passed a law to introduce same-sex marriage. The first gay marriages have recently taken place in England and Wales, with Scotland due to follow later this year. Ahead of the latest Stormont vote, the human rights organisation Amnesty International said Northern Ireland politicians would not be able to block same-sex marriage indefinitely. The debate, led by Sinn Féin, began on Tuesday with the party insisting this was an equality issue. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) backed the motion which also supported freedom of religion. The DUP is opposed and tabled a petition of concern ensuring the motion would be blocked under the Northern Ireland Assembly's cross- community voting rules. The party had argued this was not about equality, nor human rights and said it was opposing the redefinition of marriage. However, when it came to the vote, the DUP did not need to depend on their veto, as the No camp had a majority of eight over the supporters of same-sex marriage. All the nationalist MLAs who took part in the vote backed gay marriage, while most unionists rejected it, with only four of them voting in favour. Alliance Party MLA are designated as \"other\", as opposed to defining themselves as unionist or nationalist in the assembly. Their party policy is also in favour of same sex-marriage, but two Alliance MLAs, Judith Cochrane and Trevor Lunn, voted against the motion. The Ulster Unionist Party voted on conscience grounds and only two UUP MLAs, Michael Copeland and Danny Kinahan, broke the unionist trend and voted in favour. Both of NI21's MLAs, Basil McCrea and John McCallister, who are designated as unionists, voted to support same-sex marriage. Jim Allister, leader of the Traditional Unionist Voice voted no while Green Party leader Steven Agnew voted yes. Patrick Corrigan, director of Amnesty International, said: \"Politicians in Northern Ireland who continue to block marriage rights for same-sex couples are like latter-day King Canutes, trying in vain to hold back the tide of equality. \"States may not discriminate with regards to the right to marry and found a family, on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. \"That obligation is clear in international law.\" The Sinn Féin motion proposed that Stormont introduce legislation similar to other jurisdictions in Britain and Ireland. The motion comes a day after Catholic bishops in Northern Ireland published an open letter to all MLAs urging them to reject the same-sex marriage motion. The letter said it undermined the principle of equality by applying it \"inappropriately\". The assembly motion said that \"other jurisdictions in Britain and Ireland have moved forward with same sex-marriage\" and that Stormont should introduce similar legislation. The motion also said religious institutions should have the freedom to decide whether or not to conduct same-sex marriages. This was the third attempt to persuade MLAs to back same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. A year ago, they rejected a similar motion by 53 votes to 42. Supporters have stepped up their campaign following the first gay weddings in England and Wales. Rallies in favour of same-sex marriage were held on Monday evening in Belfast and Londonderry. As well as the Catholic Church, the Evangelical Alliance made its opposition to the motion clear."}
{"text": "The undercover operatives were recruited by the Army, MI5 and Special Branch and many were involved in criminality and murder. Ex-Met Police commissioner Lord Stevens said the agents caused huge problems in Northern Ireland. The government says collusion with paramilitaries should never happen. Lord Stevens led three government investigations into the security forces in Northern Ireland and has revealed the scale of the counter-intelligence operation for the first time. Lord Stevens also told BBC Panorama that thousands of agents and informants were recruited during the Troubles, and that just one of the agents - Brian Nelson - may be linked to \"dozens and dozens\" of murders. Nelson, who was a paid army agent, provided assassination targets for the three main Loyalist paramilitary groups - the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Red Hand Commando. During his investigations in Northern Ireland, Lord Stevens and his team arrested 210 paramilitary suspects. He says that 207 of them were agents or informants for the state. Baroness Nuala O'Loan, who was Northern Ireland's first police ombudsman, also found evidence that state agents were involved in murder. She tells Panorama that the security forces failed to control their undercover operatives. \"They were running informants and their argument was that they were saving lives, but hundreds and hundreds of people died because these people were not brought to justice,\" she said. \"There was impunity really for these people to go on committing their crimes. Many of them were killers, some were serial killers.\" One Special Branch agent in north Belfast has been linked to 20 murders. Mark Haddock, who ran one of the Ulster Volunteer Force's most notorious terror gangs, was paid at least Â£79,000 for his work as a police agent. The police ombudsman of Northern Ireland is currently investigating 60 murder cases where the state has been accused of involvement. These investigations were delayed because the police refused to hand over crucial evidence to the ombudsman. But following a court challenge last year, the new Chief Constable George Hamilton agreed to hand over the intelligence files. He told the programme that he was willing to work with the ombudsman, but the information needs to be handled carefully. \"There is a need to understand the sheer magnitude of what we are dealing with. We are talking about rooms full of material. \"Some of it is very sensitive, some of which if it is released in the wrong circumstances would be outside of legislation, some of it if released in the wrong circumstances could put lives at risk.\" The government says that the vast majority of those who served in the security forces did so with distinction. It says collusion with paramilitaries should never happen and the government has apologised where it did.

{"text": "Ms Ghavami was freed because of health problems and was staying with her parents in Tehran awaiting a decision by the Court of Appeal, they said. Ms Ghavami, 25, was part of a group of women arrested after trying to watch the match on 20 June. Iranian prosecutors have since accused her of having links to the opposition. Ms Ghavami has staged hunger strikes against her detention, while hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition calling for her release. Her brother, Iman Ghavami, told the BBC's Newshour that their parents - who are in Iran - had wanted to ask for a full medical check-up because Ms Ghavami had \"intestinal problems\". Mr Ghavami said his sister had served five months of a one-year sentence and that the release \"was quite unexpected but a welcome move\". \"Everyone is happy - my parents and my sister. There are many possibilities, we're not really sure what's going to happen, but we hope for the best outcome. \"For the time being... it's her 26th birthday tomorrow morning, so I think they're going to celebrate for a day or so.\" Iran's Sharq newspaper said on its Twitter account (in Persian) that she was released after paying bail amounting to $38,000 (Â£24,000). Ms Ghavami and the other women were arrested and allegedly beaten after attempting to watch Iran play Italy in a volleyball match. They were later freed, but Ms Ghavami was rearrested later and subsequently put on trial. Iran banned women from men's volleyball games in 2012, extending a long-standing ban on football matches. The Iranian authorities have argued that women need protection from the lewd behaviour of male fans. Ms Ghavami has held hunger strikes in prison, protesting against what she called her illegal detention. There had previously been confusion over Ms Ghavami's situation. Her lawyer said on 2 November that he had been shown court documents that said Ms Ghavami was found guilty of spreading anti-regime propaganda. However, prosecutors did not confirm her conviction, prompting her family to accuse the judiciary of keeping Ms Ghavami's case in limbo. Prosecutors then told Isna news agency on 18 November that Ms Ghavami's case was under review, and that she had been charged for taking part in opposition protests abroad, not for attempting to watch the match. On Saturday, Ms Ghavami's family said they had seen the verdict, and that Ms Ghavami had been given a two-year travel ban in addition to a one-year jail sentence. Ms Ghavami's MP in Hammersmith, London, welcomed the news, describing her as \"a young woman of great courage\". Andy Slaughter said \"we must continue the campaign until charges against her are dropped and she is free to travel outside Iran\". The UK Foreign Office has previously expressed \"concerns about the grounds for this prosecution, due process during the trial, and [Ms] Ghavami's treatment whilst in custody\". Ms Ghavami is both a British and Iranian national. However, dual nationality is not recognised in Iran. The British government recognises dual nationality. However, under international law, countries cannot offer formal diplomatic protection to their nationals if they are in a second country where they also hold nationality."}

{"text": "BBC News found that out of 89 transport authority areas, just 29 reported a rise in the number of passenger trips. Campaigners blamed government cuts and said there was a \"danger of whole networks of bus services being lost\". The government said it was investing £250m into bus services this year. The biggest percentage drop was in Redcar and Cleveland where figures showed 27% fewer bus journeys made in 2014-15 compared with 2009-10. It meant numbers were down from 5.7 to 4.1 million journeys, according to official Department for Transport figures. However, the figures reveal vast differences across the country. West Berkshire has recorded a 44% rise in bus journeys over the same period while Poole saw a 39% increase and North Somerset a 30% rise. London's bus use has also risen by just under 6%. Meanwhile, bus fares have continued to rise. In the West Midlands, bus company National Express imposed a 10p price hike on a single adult fare at the start of January, when figures showed diesel prices were at a six-year low. Bus journeys across Birmingham, the Black Country, Coventry and Solihull have fallen from 294 million journeys in 2010-11 to 275 million in 2014-15, while the fare has gone from £1.80 to £2.30. A National Express West Midlands spokeswoman said a quarter of passengers, such as those using smartcards or daysaver tickets had seen their fares frozen, while the company was also investing £4m in new buses. \"Fuel makes up a fairly small percentage of National Express' costs,\" she said. She said the largest cost came from wages, and the company was proud to have recently become a Living Wage employer. The spokeswoman added: \"Like many companies, National Express buys its fuel a long time in advance. This enables us to plan ahead, smooth out costs and not be affected by every price fluctuation at the pumps.\" The company said cheaper petrol, online shopping and the decline of the high street may have contributed to the decline. Subsidies for bus services were cut following the 2010 Spending Review, prompting 70% of councils to reduce funding for services, while many operators increased fares. Martin Abrams, from the Campaign for Better Transport, said: \"Across the country, we are seeing a very worrying trend of declining bus usage, a decline which correlates with the huge funding cuts to local authority supported buses we've seen over recent years. \"We really are in danger of seeing whole networks of bus services being lost. Buses play a crucial role in helping people to access jobs, shops, education and are a lifeline for older people ensuring they are not left in isolation. He added:  \"Passengers will want to know why low fuel prices can't be reflected in lower bus fares.\" The new Buses Bill is expected to let areas with directly-elected mayors take responsibility for running their own services, which the government said would lead to improvements. A Department for Transport spokesman said it was providing £250m to support bus services and almost 10 million older and disabled people qualified for concessions. \"Bus services provide vital transport links by helping communities thrive and grow,\" he said."}
{"text": "A member of the Montabaur flight school where Andreas Lubitz took lessons confirmed to BBC News the co-pilot had flown a glider over the region. Mr Lubitz was on holiday at the time, several years ago, Dieter Wagner said. A French newspaper reports that the co-pilot holidayed at a local flying club with his parents from the age of nine. Investigators are trying to establish what may have motivated Mr Lubitz to seize sole control of the Airbus A320 and crash it. German prosecutors believe he was concealing an illness from his employer, Germanwings, at the time of the crash. Data from the voice recorder suggests the 27-year-old purposely started an eight-minute descent into the mountains after locking the pilot out of the flight deck. There were no survivors when Flight 4U 9525 crashed in a remote Alpine valley on Tuesday while en route from Barcelona in Spain to Duesseldorf in Germany. Prosecutors say there was no evidence of a political or religious motive for his actions and no suicide note has been found. Mr Lubitz flew a glider over the southern French Alps during a holiday with the flight school in Montabaur, his home town, Dieter Wagner told the BBC. He had been holidaying there before he became a professional airline pilot. Mr Wagner, who says he last saw the young man five or six years ago, was quoted by French newspaper Le Parisien (in French) as saying the co-pilot had been \"passionate about the Alps and even obsessed [with them]\". Another French news outlet, Metro News, reports that Mr Lubitz holidayed with his parents from the age of nine at the flying club in Sisteron, 69km (43 miles) from Le Vernet, a village near the crash site. Quoting a \"friend of his parents\", the paper said in its report (in French) the family had stayed at a nearby campsite and Andreas had come across as a \"normal boy\". Metro News quoted Francis Keser, a designer at the club in Sisteron, as saying Mr Lubitz had \"known the area well\". Unanswered questions What drives people to murder-suicide? Who was Andreas Lubitz? According to prosecutors, torn-up sick notes were found at the co-pilot's tow addresses in Germany, including one for the day of the crash. A hospital in the German city of Duesseldorf has confirmed Mr Lubitz was a patient there recently but it denied media reports that he had been treated for depression. The theory that a mental illness such as depression had affected the co-pilot was suggested by German media, quoting internal aviation authority documents. They said he had suffered a serious depressive episode while training in 2009. He reportedly went on to receive treatment for a year and a half and was recommended regular psychological assessment. Mr Lubitz's employers insisted that he had only been allowed to resume training after his suitability was \"re-established\". French police say the search for passenger remains and debris on the mountain slopes could take another two weeks. In the aftermath of the crash, the EU's aviation regulator, the European Aviation Safety Agency, has urged airlines to adopt new safety rules. In future, it says, two crew members should be present in the cockpit at all times. Source: Aviation Safety Network"}
{"text": "Anders Kristiansen said \"reduced footfall and a highly promotional environment on the high street\" had contributed to the figures. New Look's pre-tax profits were Â£30.1m in the run-up to the festive period. Meanwhile, UK retail sales in general grew more slowly in January. The British Retail Consortium attributed the drop to consumers reining in spending after Christmas. Despite New Look's fall in profits, total sales rose 0.8% to Â£422.6m, although like-for-like sales fell by 4.7%. In the UK, the company opened four more standalone menswear stores, bringing the total to 19, and it also enjoyed record online sales on Black Friday. Meanwhile in China, where it now has more than 100 stores, the company recorded positive like-for-like sales. Mr Kristiansen added: \"Globally, fast fashion is getting faster. The consumer mindset is shifting, driven by social media, to a 'buy now, wear now' mentality. \"We have responded accordingly by improving our buying processes, working to achieve a faster supply chain, tightening our stock control and strengthening our buying and design teams to deliver a stronger product proposition.\" He put the rise in total sales down to good performances outside the UK, online and in menswear, explaining that the fact the company was selling in a variety of places had been crucial. \"It remains key to our growth to continue to diversify our offer and to invest in our priority international markets,\" he said. \"We are clear on the actions needed to capture customer spend, but these will take time to implement. \"While we expect 2017 to be tough and are setting our plans accordingly, we strongly believe in our ability to continue to execute our strategy.\" Honor Strachan, lead analyst at data providers GlobalData, said New Look's shops had lost customers to internet-based rivals. \"The strength of the online competition has dampened the appeal of New Look's physical stores,\" she said. \"The fashion-led product mix, attractive pricing and inspiring shopping experience at the likes of boohoo.com, Missguided and ASOS continue to encourage New Look's core shopper base to browse and shop more online reducing the need to visit physical stores. \"This shift has benefited New Look's online platform as has its investment in product styling, delivery options and editorial content.\" Meanwhile, the BRC figures revealed that general retail sales had inched up 0.1% year-on-year, a big slowdown from the 1.7% increase in December and the weakest performance since last August. The change was largely because of slower non-food sales, although spending on groceries held up. The BRC said consumers were feeling cautious going into the new year. \"Looking across the last three months, we've seen the slowest growth of the festive period since 2009,\" BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson added. \"After a strong end to the Christmas trading, year-on-year sales growth ground to a halt. \"While this may appear disappointing overall, retailers were up against a strong January last year to try and deliver a repeat performance and many reported an increase in the number of returns received in January.\" According to the research, consumers had cut back on non-essentials, although sales of furniture climbed towards the end of the year. Spending on food rose 2% in the quarter, while online sales jumped 8.6% as more shoppers shunned the high street."}
{"text": "The South Western Ambulance Service pilot began in February. It gives staff three minutes, rather than the current government target of one minute, to assess calls that are not immediately life threatening. The trial was launched in response to the \"unprecedented increase in demand for ambulance services\". It was announced by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt in January and covers Cornwall, Isles of Scilly, Devon, Dorset, Wiltshire, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Somerset and South Gloucestershire. He said the aim was to establish if allowing a longer assessment could help ambulance services maintain or even improve the clinical outcomes for patients. In situations where a patient is not breathing or unconscious, an ambulance is still dispatched within the 60 seconds. Neil Le Chevalier, South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust's director of operations, said since the pilot began it had doubled its \"hear and treat\" rate because it had the time to assess and advise over the phone. \"It's been very successful and there have been no safety issues,\" he told BBC News. He said the main benefit was being able to determine the most appropriate response. \"When somebody dials 999, they're in a panic, so it can take up to 45 seconds just trying to find out where the patient is and we're frequently sending an ambulance out under blue lights on an address incident only, not knowing what we're dealing with,\" he said. \"This new pilot gives us two extra minutes to ascertain exactly what's wrong.\" In the first 26 weeks, he said more than 400,000 emergency calls had gone through the system with \"70,000 ambulances not dispatched\". Mr Le Chevalier said call handlers ask a series of questions using a triage system of assessment approved by the Royal College of Surgeons and they also have a directory of services available to them. \"Instead of dispatching an ambulance, we can send a mental health team, a falls team or indeed refer to a GP if that's more appropriate,\" he added."}

Andy Boyle and Daryl Horgan from League of Ireland champions Dublin are part of the 27-man travelling squad. McClean missed Tuesday's session because of a back problem, and the West Brom winger trained alone on Wednesday under the supervision of a fitness coach. His return to full training on Thursday, alongside John O'Shea who has recovered from his recent hamstring problems, is a major boost to the Republic's manager Martin O'Neill.

When asked why the striker might feel unsure of his future, Guardiola said: \"I don't think he feels that way. \"Sergio knows the intention of his manager and the club. I don't want to sell him, I want him to stay here for a long time until he decides. \"The reason he's not played the last two games is because Leroy [Sane], Gabriel and Rash [Raheem Sterling] have played amazing.

Research suggests only one in 10 people come to Northern Ireland for the food experience, fewer still from the Republic of Ireland. \"I do not think it is ever the sole purpose to come to any destination, with the exception perhaps of San Sebastian or somewhere like that in Spain,\" said Mr McGrillen. \"But it is a very critical element of people's experiences and about one third of what people spend is actually on food and drink.\" Food and drink spend by external visitors was in the region of Â£140m in 2012.

{"text": "Quagga mussels have been discovered at Wraysbury reservoir, near Heathrow Airport, the Wildfowl and Wetland Trust (WWT) said. The molluscs form large colonies on hard surfaces and can block pipes and cause flooding, the trust said. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it would take action to tackle the threat. Some scientists say the mussel poses the maximum risk to the UK environment of any non-native species. The 4cm (1.5in) bivalves originated in Ukraine and spread across Europe as new canals opened, a WWT spokesman said. They were introduced to the US by ships discharging their ballast in the Great Lakes. Sources: Environment Agency and the National Wildlife Federation The species is flourishing in Lake Mead, formed by the Hoover dam, and engineers are working to stop them colonising the dam's turbines and blocking the pipes which supply water to Las Vegas, the spokesman said. Earlier this year a group of scientists at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) identified the quagga mussel as the single greatest threat to the UK's wildlife of any alien species. Dr Helen Roy, one of the scientists involved in the research, said that, after looking at hundreds of species from all over the world, the quagga mussel was the most likely to arrive and establish itself in the UK and pose a danger to biodversity there. Sarah Chare, from the Environment Agency, said the quagga mussel affected water quality as well as clogging up pipes. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said it would be working to reduce the risks of the quagga mussels spreading any further. A spokesman said: \"It is important that we take action to address the threats posed by invasive non-native species. \"Users of our waterways can help with this by checking their equipment and keeping it clean and dry.\" A Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust spokesman said the trusts's London Wetland Centre, downstream from Wraysbury \"is the sort of place [where] they'll wreak havoc with the wildlife, if left unchecked\". Jeff Knott, from the WWT, said: \"These tiny mussels can be devastating but look so innocuous. \"Quagga mussels are likely to indirectly cause suffering and death for hundreds of thousands of native animals, fish and plants and cost millions of pounds in tax and water bills to protect drinking water supplies.\""}

{"text": "Hundreds of sheep, cows and donkeys are corralled or tethered to metal bars where they are inspected by butchers and other prospective buyers. The sound of bleating and neighing competes against intense haggling over the final price. Kashgar remains a city where trading is very much in the blood. It stands on the Silk Road - the trade route of ancient times stretching from the eastern Chinese city of Xian to the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. With the advent of major shipping lanes, however, the overland routes fell out of use and Kashgar became something of a backwater. But now Kashgar is experiencing its biggest economic boom in living memory. Beijing is pouring billions of dollars into a city which it designated as a special economic zone back in 2010 - one of only half a dozen such zones in the country. The authorities want to transform Kashgar into the transport hub of old - opening up markets in Central Asia and beyond. \"The opportunities here are priceless,\" says Zhang Yunjian, a spokesman for Gangzhou New City project in Kashgar. \"That's why you see so many investors coming to the city to start businesses.\" Currently the largest construction project underway in Kashgar, the development is will house 100,000 people and have a shopping complex along with recreational facilities. \"I believe that Kashgar could one day catch up and even surpass the development we see in other Chinese cities,\" says Zhang Yunjian. Beijing believes that economic development will help ease ethnic tensions not only in Kashgar but across the remote western Chinese region of Xinjiang - one of the poorest parts in the country. Xinjiang is home to approximately nine million Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic minority. The Chinese authorities frequently accuse Uighurs of fomenting unrest - and some activists do want their own independent state. In 2009, the region witnessed an explosion of ethnic violence partly fuelled by economic grievances. In the capital, Urumqi, Uighurs clashed with Han Chinese - the majority ethnic group in China. Almost 200 people were killed. All the development is changing the face of Kashgar and not just in terms of construction. Source: Kashgar City Government website A decade ago the city was almost entirely Uighur but now a third of the population is Han Chinese, according to local officials. This migration is creating a fresh set of tensions. Many Uighurs complain that they are not sharing in the economic boom. They say that most of the profits are going to Han Chinese entrepreneurs. \"We aren't really seeing any benefit from all the construction,\" said one Uighur, whose family have made traditional musical instruments for generations. \"Why else would they (Han Chinese) travel thousands of kilometres if they weren't profiting?\" Evidence of the tensions in Kashgar is everywhere. A fire engine sits outside the city's biggest mosque equipped with a water cannon ready to disperse any angry crowd. In Kashgar's main square, under the watchful gaze of a six-storey-high statue of Chairman Mao, there are dozens of armed police, armoured personnel carriers, along with military trucks and vans. Check-points ring the city where Uighurs have to get out of their vehicles to show their identity cards and sometimes be frisked. Han Chinese tourists visiting the city travel with police escorts. Armed guards are posted at their hotels. One Han Chinese entrepreneur in the city to scout out opportunities said he felt safe \"because they are so many police on the streets.\" Uighurs have long complained about repression under China's rule. In July, marking the third anniversary of the riots in Urumqi, the London-based rights group Amnesty International issued a statement saying that Chinese authorities \"continue to silence those speaking out on abuses\" in the region. Many Uighurs also say that their traditions and culture are under threat. Nowhere is more apparent than Kashgar's historic old city, which dates back hundreds of years. Built from mud bricks, houses are piled on top of each other along a warren of paved alleyways. For centuries, the city has stood as a symbol of Uighur identity. But now locals say that more than half of it has already been torn down and thousands of families have already left. Many Uighurs fear that a huge part of their culture has been lost forever. The local authorities say that the demolition is necessary because houses may collapse as Xinjiang is an earthquake zone. They are rebuilding chunks of the old city in the traditional style. But that is of little comfort to Tursun Zunun, 53, a pottery maker in the old city. He says that his house is almost 500 years old. \"Many of my neighbours have already left,\" he said, sitting out his balcony, which now has a view of the city's new skyline of modern high rise office and apartment blocks. \"By the time my grand-daughter grows up all the old city might be gone.\" Kashgar is a city that has long mixed traditions with trade. But an old way of life is fast disappearing, creating a fresh source of anger among the Uighur community. The city's economic development may not bring the stability Beijing wants."}
{"text": "The Markit/CIPS UK manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 57.3 from 54.2 in March, well above economists' expectations. A reading above 50 indicates growth. Markit said the sector enjoyed \"solid improvement\" last month, with new orders being received at the fastest rate since January 2014. The survey found the main source of new work came from the domestic market, but there was a \"solid increase in new export business\" due to a combination of better global economic conditions and the weakening of the pound. The fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote in June has made UK goods cheaper for foreign buyers, but has also pushed up the cost of imports for UK companies. Markit said price pressures faced by manufacturers remained \"elevated\", but noted that input cost inflation had \"eased significantly\" since January. \"Although only accounting for 10% of the economy, the upturn in the manufacturing sector represents some welcome good news after the sharp slowing in GDP seen in the first quarter,\" said Rob Dobson, senior economist at INS Markit. \"The big question is whether this growth spurt can be maintained, especially given the backdrop of ongoing market volatility and a number of political headwinds such as elections at home and abroad. \"Other surges seen since the middle of last year have generally proved short-lived, as weak wage growth sapped consumer spending.\" Official figures from the Office for National Statistics last week indicated that the UK economy grew by just 0.3% in the first three months of the year, the slowest rate since the first quarter of 2016."}

{"text": "The reason, they say is that pupils in Wales sit exams in November or January, as well as in the summer. But we will only get the results of the summer exams on Thursday. We will have to wait until November for all the results, which were quite a bit higher than the summer-only results last year. For example, last year the November results for maths were 11% higher for A*to C grades than the summer cohort. But in England, more pupils sit the exams in the summer and, as the Welsh government says \"In England, where there was much lower early entry, there was far less of a change between summer outcomes and the academic year outcomes published in January. \"It is a strong possibility that this scenario will occur again this year, with the inevitable impact on the ability to make comparisons between the sets of results.\" The reason for the difference is that in England pupils only have one go at sitting an exam. It was an attempt to stop schools encouraging pupils  to take GCSEs early so they can \"bank\" good grades - simply entering them for retakes if they fail. Although Welsh Education Minister Huw Lewis has said schools here should not \"game the system\" he has ruled out following England's lead and banning re-sits. So on Thursday, we will just get the results from the summer exams. Back in July in a debate about education standards in Wales, Mr Lewis also reiterated an assertion I first highlighted back in November last year, which is this: \"In 2011, the level 2 inclusive gap with England stood at 8.9 percentage points and was truly a subject for concern. \"By last year, that gap had fallen and closed to 1.4 percentage points. Now, I wonder whether, this summer, we'll see that gap close to nothing, or even, and it's quite conceivable, that Wales overtakes England in terms of attainment at GCSE.\" To people who are not education policy wonks, \"the level 2 inclusive\" means the number of 15-year-olds getting five GCSEs A* to C, including English or Welsh and maths. So what Mr Lewis was saying last month was that pupils in Wales might overtake England in this very important benchmark. So why does he say that? Well, the gap between Wales and England has been narrowing steadily year-on-year. But last year, while results in Wales jumped, in England they dropped quite a bit. So the gap was just 1.4%. However, it has since been suggested the results in England were a bit of a one-off due to \"methodology and examination changes\"  and that, in fact, England is still a fair bit ahead of Wales on GCSE results. We will all find out on Thursday."}

{"text": "The fictional character was one of just seven people picked for the Power List to mark the show's 70th birthday. She was described as \"a flawed heroine\" by the chair of the judging panel. Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher topped the list, while pop star Beyonce and feminist academic Germaine Greer also made the cut. Helen Brook, who set up the Brook Advisory Centres in 1964 offering contraceptive advice to unmarried women, was also chosen. The other women listed were Barbara Castle, the Labour MP who brought in the Equal Pay Act in 1970; and Jayaben Desai, who campaigned against low pay and poor conditions for women workers. BBC 5 live presenter Emma Barnett, who chaired the judges, said Bridget Jones had been a divisive choice for the panel. But she said the list was about who has \"actually had impact in real women's lives... impact doesn't have to be good, bad, serious or funny\". The character \"gave permission for our own imperfections... we still have huge image issues in this country\", Barnett explained. Bridget Jones creator Helen Fielding said it was a \"tremendous honour for Bridget and, of course, for me\". She added: \"I hope it doesn't mean everyone's going to binge drink and eat Milk Tray late at night. \"I also hope there was something rather more profound going on, there's something in Bridget's nature which is very British which is ultimately quite decent, quite kind, quite resilient, not judgemental.\" She said Bridget, who first appeared in a newspaper column in 1995 and went on to feature in hit books and films, had caught the zeitgeist and that \"women were fed up of being presented in movies and in fiction as not being able to speak for themselves\". Woman's Hour presenters Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey will host a special edition of the programme on Wednesday at 10:00 GMT to celebrate the chosen women. It was recorded at Buckingham Palace at a reception attended by The Duchess of Cornwall. In deciding on the final seven names, the judges considered a woman's body of work or her role as a catalyst for change over the past 70 years, as well as those having an impact today. Sophie Walker, leader of the Women's Equality Party, said: \"It is interesting that all but two of these women are 'second-wavers'. \"We are excited about the next generation of activists, thinkers and writers fighting for social and political justice in the 21st Century and look forward to seeing them on future power lists.\" Woman's Hour publishes a Power List every year, with a different theme each time. This was the first year where dead women or those outside the UK were considered. Barnett said: \"The list takes in a range of experiences across a range of ages. We hope the list inspires, educates and crucially shines a light on the work of some women who history may already be starting to forget.\" Barnett was joined on the panel by business leader and Apprentice star Karren Brady; former Labour adviser and commentator Ayesha Hazarika; award-winning screenwriter Abi Morgan; former Woman's Hour editor Jill Burridge; and networking expert and author Julia Hobsbawm.

Police investigators calculated he was doing at least 58 mph in a 40 mph speed limit, the High Court in Edinburgh heard. Brown, who had a previous conviction for speeding, lost control on a bend. Detectives concluded he must have been driving too fast after experts studied tyre marks left on the road. The court heard how a paramedic who came to the scene found the car lying on its side and \"folded around the tree.\" Prosecution lawyer Jane Farquharson said Brown, who is now aged 20, was \"good friends\" with Mr Phimister. They saw each other on a \"daily basis\". The court heard how they spent most evenings driving around the local area. Ms Farquharson said: \"From the marks on the road and the damage profile seen on the car, the accused Mr Brown approached the bend in the road at excessive speed. \"Whilst trying to take the shortest possible route around the inside of the bend, he lost control of his vehicle which caused the car to yaw. \"This in turn caused his car to travel off the road and strike the tree.\" As Brown was being taken to hospital for treatment, he spoke to a paramedic. \"On his way to the hospital, the accused Mr Brown spoke of the accident to a paramedic,\" Ms Farquharson said. \"In respect of his manoeuvre around the bend, he volunteered information that whilst he normally dropped down to the third gear for that corner, because he was tired he didn't and he could just remember skidding.\" Defence solicitor advocate Gordon Martin said his client and his deceased were \"best friends\" and that he expressed remorse for what happened. Mr Martin added: \"Mr Brown appreciates that his expression of remorse will be of no comfort to the friends and family of Mr Phimister. \"It should be noted the deceased and Mr Brown were best friends.\" Mr Martin said that because his client had never served a prison sentence, the court was legally obliged to obtain reports about Mr Brown's character. The lawyer said he would deliver his plea of mitigation when the court obtained these reports. The judge deferred sentence on Brown to 22 November 2016.

He attended Wordsworth Infants School, Shirley Junior School, Bellemoor secondary school and Tauntons College. Mr Ellery was a big music fan and had a saying that he \"didn't like to listen to music, he liked to hear it\". After leaving school at 18, he found jobs in retail, at a mortgage company office and in the building industry. He was once keen to become a plasterer and worked on the family house when it was improved in 2003. In March 2005, he left the family home to move in with two school friends in Ipswich and found work at Jessops. He enjoyed his new job and used to return to his flatmates enthusing about the latest gadgets. In a letter to the inquest, Mr Ellery's father said his son had \"grown into a confident and very sociable man\" and \"had been beginning a new and very positive phase in his life\". His new employer closed all its 280 stores for the national two-minute silence on 14 July 2005. The manager of the Ipswich branch, David Gunn, said Richard had become a very popular member of staff in the five weeks he had been working there. In his police statement, Mr Stopani said: \"Richard also had a knack of making you feel better just by talking to him. You would go to him with a moan or a gripe and come away feeling so much better, but Richard would just say he had done nothing.\""}
{"text": "A Democratic Party spokesman has called the reports \"extremely disturbing\". The US authorities are probing possible collusion between the Trump team and Russia. Intelligence agencies think Russia tried to help Mr Trump to power. Russia denies this, and the president says there was no collusion. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Mr Trump and his team were looking at ways to pardon people close to him. Presidents can pardon people before guilt is established or even before the person is charged with a crime. Describing the reports as disturbing, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said \"pardoning any individuals who may have been involved would be crossing a fundamental line\". On Saturday, Mr Trump tweeted: \"While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon, why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us. FAKE NEWS.\" Mr Trump also attacked \"illegal leaks\" following reports his attorney general discussed campaign-related matters with a Russian envoy. The Washington Post gave an account of meetings Attorney General Jeff Sessions held with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. The newspaper quoted current and former US officials who cited intelligence intercepts of Mr Kislyak's version of the encounter to his superiors. One of those quoted said Mr Kislyak spoke to Mr Sessions about key campaign issues, including Mr Trump's positions on policies significant to Russia. During his confirmation hearing earlier this year, Mr Sessions said he had no contact with Russians during the election campaign. When it later emerged he had, he said the campaign was not discussed at the meetings. An official confirmed to Reuters the detail of the intercepts, but there has been no independent corroboration. The officials spoken to by the Post said that Mr Kislyak could have exaggerated the account, and cited a Justice Department spokesperson who repeated that Mr Sessions did not discuss interference in the election. But the Post's story was the focus of one of many tweets the US president fired off on Saturday morning. \"A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Post, this time against A.G. Jeff Sessions. These illegal leaks, like Comey's, must stop!\" Mr Trump said. The Washington Post is owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who has been an occasional sparring partner for Mr Trump. \"Comey\" refers to James Comey, the former FBI boss Mr Trump fired. Earlier this week, Mr Trump told the New York Times he regretted hiring Mr Sessions because he had stepped away from overseeing an inquiry into alleged Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Sessions recused himself in March amid pressure over his meetings with Mr Kislyak. He says he plans to continue in his role as attorney general. Several other regular targets for Mr Trump featured in his series of tweets. He accused the \"failing\" New York Times of foiling an attempt to assassinate the leader of the Islamic State group, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. It is not clear what Mr Trump was referring to, but on Saturday a US general complained on Fox News that a \"good lead\" on Baghdadi was leaked to a national newspaper in 2015. A New York Times report at the time revealed that valuable information had been extracted from a raid, but the paper stressed on Saturday that no-one had taken issue with their reporting until now. And Mr Trump again urged Republicans to \"step up to the plate\" and repeal and replace President Obama's healthcare reforms, a key campaign pledge of his that has collapsed in Congress.

Natural England has been overseeing the safe removal of the protected great crested newts to secure areas nearby. Ecologists need to remove protected species and other wildlife to safe areas before building work can begin. Specially-trained Rocky is being brought in for a week to ensure none remain along the 12-mile (20km) route. Since the warm spring weather brought the newts out of hibernation, more than 7km (4.3 miles) of amphibian fencing has been used to steer them into bucket traps in the three areas on the route of the Norwich Northern Distributor Road. More newt news and other Norfolk stories The buckets are checked daily by ecologists and any creatures inside are transferred to more suitable habitats away from the development site. So far, more than 340 great crested newts have been relocated together with 450 smooth newts, about 850 toads, 90 frogs and an assortment of reptiles and mammals, including a baby hedgehog. Two-year-old Rocky will be tasked with using his sensitive nose to sniff out any remaining newts. Trainer Aran Clyne, from sniffer dog firm Wagtail UK, said it takes several months to train a dog to identify wildlife. \"It's all about building an association between the newt smell and Rocky's reward, the tennis ball,\" he said. \"Whenever he finds a newt, he gets his ball.\" This is Rocky's first foray into newt conservation as he is more used to sniffing out bats, another protected species, on sites designated for new windfarms. Once he has located the wayward newts, they will be moved by hand. Norfolk County Council, who employed Rocky, said: \"Using a sniffer dog is a quick, efficient and cost-effective way of carrying out final checks of cleared areas. Without a trained sniffer dog all suitable areas would have to be laboriously searched by hand by ecologists.\""}

Echo owners who take this option would pay less than half the monthly fee of an Apple Music, Spotify, Google Play or Tidal subscription. One expert said Amazon was not trying to poach customers from rivals. But it was seeking to encourage existing customers to spend more, said Chris Cooke of the music industry news site CMU. \"At the moment you either use a free streaming service such as Spotify free or YouTube, or pay $10 [Â£8] a month, there's nothing in the middle,\" he said. \"There has been a big conversation about creating a middle-market, mid-price service. \"But what would make it better than a free service, but less good than a full paid service? \"Amazon's answer is to lock it to one device.\" Amazon Music Unlimited service has a library of \"tens of millions of songs\", compared with its existing Prime Music catalogue of two million. As with Apple Music, Google Play Music, Spotify and Tidal, the monthly subscription fee for Amazon Music Unlimited is $9.99. However, existing Amazon Prime customers can add the service to their subscription for $7.99, undercutting rivals. People who wish to listen to music only through their Echo speaker pay the reduced fee of $3.99. Songs play free of advertising, and playlists can be saved to listen to offline. The service is available as a smartphone app, website and is integrated with Amazon devices such as the Fire TV stick and Echo speaker. The Echo speaker lets people choose music to listen to with voice commands such as: \"Alexa, play Lately by Lisa Scott-Lee.\" and: \"Alexa, play songs from the 90s.\" It already integrates with Spotify Premium, although it sometimes struggles to interpret song titles or artist names ordered by voice command. Amazon said the new Music Unlimited service would also respond to commands such as: \"Play the song that goes...\" followed by lyrics, or: \"Play dinner-party music.\" Google has already unveiled a rival voice-controlled speaker, which can find songs on Google Play Music with commands such as: \"Play the Shakira song from the film Zootopia.\" Amazon Music Unlimited launched in the US on Wednesday, with a UK launch to follow later in 2016. \"The ambition is to package this in with the Echo device,\" said Mr Cooke. \"They're hoping that Â£50 a year will be cheap enough, and people will like it so much that they will subscribe. \"It's about offering a better range of prices for bigger range of people - and Amazon already has a massive ready-made audience to sell this to.\""}

Regan Grace made it two tries in a row to extend St Helens' lead after Greg Eden's tries brought Cas within two. Ben Roberts sneaked in with the hooter beckoning, but the Tigers fell short. Although Cas won at St Helens in pre-season, their last competitive victory in the town came in the 1992 Regal Trophy, two seasons after their last league success, at Knowsley Road. There was much optimism surrounding their trip across the M62, given the upheaval at Saints following Keiron Cunningham's departure and, when they took an early eight-point lead, it seemed as though they might bring their jinx to a halt. However Saints scored 20 points without reply, with tries from Matty Fleming, Luke Douglas and the influential Mark Percival, who kicked five goals. The second half both began and finished in the same vein, with tries from Roberts, but Saints did enough in between to hold out and give the interim coaching team of Jamahl Lolesi, Sean Long and Derek Traynor their first win in charge. St Helens coach Sean Long: \"The boys turned up and it was a short turnaround following the Good Friday game against Wigan. We found a way to win and Cas are a class team and to beat them is pleasing. \"I thought we could have closed this game out a bit easier but I can't fault the boys' effort, it was unreal. \"Regan [Grace] was good. He's been working really hard and has pace to burn but has a lot to learn.

Weight of possession at Easter is always going to be crucial - and we were on the wrong end of it. \"We were just not right in between our ears today.

Minister for Communities and Tackling Poverty Lesley Griffiths joined community representatives, equality bodies and Sport Wales for a panel discussion on Tuesday. The panel discussed the study at the Pierhead, in Cardiff Bay. Sport Wales chair Prof Laura McAllister said: \"Regrettably, there is still a stubborn inequality when it comes to people who come from Wales' black and minority ethnic communities. \"As an organisation, we regard that as unacceptable.\" Sarah Powell, chief executive of Sport Wales, added: \"Sport should be for all - we all have the right to access opportunities to get involved and stay active and healthy, regardless of our backgrounds. \"There are some excellent examples where sports have worked hard to break down barriers and as a result seen positive results but sadly it's clear there are still those who feel they cannot access sport or have no place within it. This needs to change.\" Sport Wales interviewed people from Indian, Polish, Chinese, African-Caribbean and other minority ethnic groups - which make up about 4.5% of Wales' total population - about their experiences. The study highlighted lower incomes, limited time, limited mobility, limited facilities, racism and language barriers, as some of the reason for lower participation among some black and minority ethnic (BME) groups. Among its recommendations were finding role models to inspire communities, making use of already established networks and working alongside them to create opportunities that fit the needs of BME communities. Ahead of Tuesday's panel discussion, Lesley Griffiths said: \"Sport can have a hugely positive impact on people's lives - helping them stay fit and active and bringing people from diverse backgrounds together. \"This research is an important contribution to our understanding of the barriers experienced by black and minority ethnic communities in accessing sport. \"The challenge is now for everyone in the sector to use this as a basis to develop innovative ways of tackling this inequality head on.\""}

The government insisted the number of 18-year-olds from deprived areas going to university was at a record level. It recently appointed Professor Peter Scott as commissioner for fair access to higher education in Scotland. His role will be \"to support disadvantaged learners and drive change across the system\". The Scottish government has said it wants to see a big rise in the number of people from deprived areas who go to university. Labour argue that, over the past two years, the gap between the number of students from the richest and poorest areas has actually widened. The party says that while the number of young people from the most deprived areas going to university has gone up 0.8% since 2014, the number from the least deprived areas rose more than three times as fast. The Scottish government says the number of 18-year-olds from Scotland's most deprived areas going to university is at a record level - but wants further and faster progress. Scottish Labour's education spokesman Iain Gray said: \"Nicola Sturgeon has promised that every child, regardless of their background, would have an equal chance of going to university. \"But those chances have become less equal while she's been first minister. \"It goes to show that warm words from the SNP aren't enough, closing the attainment gap will take more investment in our schools. \"Labour will continue to make the case for a 50p top rate of tax on those earning more than Â£150,000 a year to invest in closing the attainment gap in schools across Scotland.\" The Scottish government said Ucas figures recorded the highest university entry rate for 18-year-olds from Scotland's 20% most deprived areas.

He said he and his children had received death threats after the family appeared on ITV's Jeremy Kyle Show. Mr Philpott and two others deny six counts of manslaughter. His wife Mairead Philpott, 31, and Paul Mosley 46, are accused of starting the fire in a bid to frame Mr Philpott's former mistress Lisa Willis, 29, who was involved in a custody battle over the four children she shared with him. On the first day of the defence case Mick Philpott told the court that Amanda Cousins, the sister of Ms Willis, had threatened to kill his wife and their children after the Philpotts had turned up at her home. He said he and his wife had also received silent calls from a withheld number in the weeks leading up to the fire. Talking about his regret at appearing on TV, he told Nottingham Crown Court he needed a bigger house as the family was growing, but people were disgusted at him having two lovers and 11 children. Until February 2012, Mr Philpott lived in a four-bedroom house with his wife Mairead and their six children as well as Ms Willis with her five children. \"The children and myself got death threats. We were called rats; the scum of the earth,\" he told the court. Jurors heard that a \"large number of people\" had keys to the house and the door was usually left unlocked. He told the court that benefits paid to his wife and Ms Willis were paid into his account but he left his bank cards out for both women to use. \"They never had to ask for money,\" he said. Mr Philpott said he had no idea that Ms Willis was going to leave him. Asked about their relationship, he said: \"At that particular time I thought that me and Lisa had this bond that was inseparable.\" He said he had discussed it with his wife because she was \"concerned\" about it. Mr Philpott told the court that he was spending a lot of time with his wife and slept in the evenings with Ms Willis. He said he had asked his wife for a divorce \"three to four times\" so he could marry Ms Willis. He said: \"It was a well known fact by everybody that Lisa wanted me to herself. But Mairead wouldn't leave me, she wasn't going anywhere.\" Jurors heard that he and his wife regularly discussed with Ms Willis what would happen should there be a split. \"We always said that if we ever split up we would never stop each other from seeing the children,\" he said. Asked how Mr and Mrs Philpott's children felt when Ms Willis Left, Mr Philpott said they were \"distraught\". \"They were so upset, so distraught. It was horrible,\" he said. He told the court that he had taken some tablets with brandy after Ms Willis left. \"Was this a suicide attempt?\" Mr Orchard asked him. \"No, it was self-pity,\" Mr Philpott replied. Mr Philpott also denied prosecution witness claims that he ever mentioned fire, burning or petrol in the weeks before the fatal blaze. Jade Philpott, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, perished in the fire at their house in Victory Road, in Allenton.

The divers first spotted the piece of industrial history two years ago and returned to recover it two months ago. Club diving officer Rob Geal, 30, from Newborough, said eight divers used a 220lb (100kg) lifting bag, \"which is basically a balloon that can be taken underwater, attached to an object and then inflated to bring it gradually to the surface\". \"It's heavily silted on the lake bed which can affect the visibility but after about four hours we'd managed to completely raise the wagon to the surface,\" he added. \"When we examined it we found that quite a bit of it was still intact, including the wooden chassis, one of the four metal wheels it originally had, a wrought iron shaft connecting the wheel to the axle and a piece of wrought iron for connecting it to other wagons.\" The wagon, which measures about 4ft (1.2m) long and 3ft (0.9m) wide, is believed to have run to the port along the old Padarn Railway, which closed in 1969 after work at the quarry ended.

Wheelchair tennis is played on a regular size court with the same balls and rackets but the athletes use specialist wheelchairs and the ball can bounce twice each side of the net. Double Paralympic bronze medallist Lucy Shuker took up the sport after she was paralysed from the waist down in a motorbike accident. She has represented Great Britain at three Paralympics and won a bronze medal in the doubles at both London 2012 and Rio 2016, alongside Jordanne Whiley. \"When I first started everyone said I was too disabled to compete,\" says Shuker. \"I'm the most disabled girl on the tour and, as much as it's tough, I've managed to develop a chair and straps that help me with my body to compete, but it's challenging every day.\" \"It's made me stronger, it's made my body better so dealing every day with my disability is easier.\" The top players travel the world to play the game with the four Grand Slams taking place in Melbourne, Paris, Wimbledon and New York.

But the number of patients successfully receiving organ transplants in Scotland fell by by 9% to 360. There were also falls in the numbers of deceased and living organ donors. According to the NHS Blood and Transplant service, the number of deceased donors in Scotland fell from 106 to 98 in the 12 months up to March of this year. The number of living donors also fell slightly to 81. Public health minister Maureen Watt said lessons could be learned from NHS Grampian, as she visited Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. Ms Watt said: \"We are making significant progress on organ donation. Since we started our plan of improvement in 2008 we have seen an 82% increase in deceased donor numbers; a 42% increase in the number of transplants undertaken and the active transplant waiting list has reduced by over 20%. \"I am particularly pleased to see such an improvement here in Grampian. It is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the many NHS staff across NHS Grampian who have worked tirelessly to make this possible. \"I am very aware that organ donation can only occur as a result of tragic circumstances and it is important that we pay tribute to the organ donors and to their families who made the decision to help others. \"We will now look to see what lessons can be learned from Grampian and see if this can be replicated in other hospitals in Scotland.\" Dr Iain Macleod, the clinician in charge of organ donation for NHS Grampian, told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"We've spent a lot of time working with the team in the intensive care unit and we have specialist nurses who deal with donation. \"We're trying to make it normal practice to ask families, at what is a terrible time for them, if their loved ones would like to donate. Just by asking that question more often we are finding families are saying yes.\" UK-wide the number of organ donations fell for the first time in 11 years with 224 fewer transplants."}

{"text": "The issue is so serious that the police has been asked to investigate Colchester General Hospital. Such a situation is unprecedented in the NHS - and as a result the temptation is to dismiss it as a one-off that should be seen in isolation. Unfortunately, it would be complacent to do so. What this case demonstrates is the problem inspectors have in identifying some issues in organisations as complex as hospitals. The Care Quality Commission did not find the dodgy records. It was told where to look. During the spring Colchester was subject to an inspection as part of the Keogh Review into mortality rates. The review - launched after the Stafford Hospital public inquiry - investigated the 14 trusts with the highest death rates. Problems were identified, including with the ways complaints were handled, staffing rates and leadership weaknesses, but not this. The concerns that were identified were not even considered important enough for Colchester to be placed in special measures. When the results of the review were announced Colchester was one of only three trusts that escaped the sanction. But towards the end of the Keogh process a whistleblower raised concerns about the tampering of records. This was passed on to the CQC which carried out its own inspections in August and September. These led to Tuesday's report that showed different information was being entered into the hospital's system than was on the patients' notes so their cancer performance data looked better than it was. The trust has now been placed in special measures and the management of the trust is being reviewed. But to make matters worse, the trust had also carried out its own probe in early 2012 after concerns were raised by admin staff in the cancer department. It did not identify serious problems, but the trust now accepts the issue was \"not properly investigated\". The fact that concerns had been aired but not properly looked into has chilling echoes of the Stafford Hospital scandal. Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, whose members raised the alarm, says: \"They raised their concerns repeatedly and in emails to senior managers, right up to the chief executive, but they were ignored.\" Last week a review of complaints by the Labour MP Ann Clywd said the culture of \"delay and denial\" had to end. The Colchester case shows just how far the NHS has to go."}

{"text": "The group was formed by childhood friends Louis Rei and cousins Haile and Akelle Charles - whose fathers were session musicians for the likes of Bob Marley. After years of struggling as solo artists, the trio created the catchy seduction song In2 in a late-night recording session earlier this year. After filming a video for Â£250, they saw the track catch fire, eventually reaching the top 10 in November - at one point outselling Adele's Hello. Named after their stomping ground in Hammersmith and Shepherd's Bush, West London, the band have attracted celebrity fans such as Wiley, Lily Allen, Wretch 32 and Rita Ora, and are frantically working on their debut album. They spoke to the BBC at the Wendy House recording studio, where their names are etched on the wall alongside the likes of Sam Smith, Ellie Goulding, Stevie Wonder and... er, Jedward. How did the band form? Louis Rei: The name only came about recently - but us, as a collective, we're family so we've been around quite a while. But the name WSTRN has only existed for a short amount of time. So what was the catalyst? Akelle: In2. The hottest track on the road right now. [laughs] How did that song come about? Louis Rei: Basically, we was all just in the studio. We didn't even go in there to make the song. We was actually just chilling and going through some beats. Then Haile went in the [vocal] booth and laid down the chorus. We was like, \"woah, what's going on here?\" How soon did you know it was going to be massive? Akelle: We didn't really. We put it to one side after we made it. It was like, \"that's cool - what's next?\" Haile: But then Akelle sent it to a DJ and that's when everything spiralled out of control. What's the most surprising thing that's happened as a result? Louis Rei: I woke up one time and saw that Alan Carr had done a parody of In2. That was just crazy. Akelle: Alan Carr did the best In2 remix! Louis Rei: Yeah, big up Alan! Both In2 and the b-side Got Love are romance songs. Should we expect more of that? Louis Rei: We just want to bring positivity back. Everything's way too serious right now, man. Akelle: I'm going to rap about personal stuff like relationships, pain that I've gone through, pain that someone else has gone through. Real life stuff that people can connect to. So they can hear the song and they're like \"Oh my God, this guy is talking about me.\" Akelle, you claim on In2 that you've been \"in and out with girls\". Are you a bit of a ladies' man? Akelle: I'm definitely a loverman! [He blushes and buries his head in his hands] Oh my God, I'm getting all shy! Why did I put that line in there?! Tell me about your background? What were you doing before WSTRN? Akelle: I started making music when I was about seven or eight. [Late reggae artist] Smiley Culture brought me and my brothers and sisters into the music industry. Like a British Jackson 5? Akelle: That's what we were trying to do. We were trying to get somewhere with our family music but it didn't really work out. Were you the Marlon or the Michael? Akelle: I was Michael. 100 per cent Michael.  I'm the youngest - so it makes sense. Do you all have similar stories? Louis Rei: My earliest recollection of music would be primary school. I think my dad wrote me a little lyric for a school project - and I remember how it felt, rapping in front of everyone. I got a buzz from that, and it's been at the back of my head ever since. Haile: In my early teen years, I did music as a hobby with all my friends. Then, from 17 upwards, I started to take it more seriously. And then I met these guys and it all happened. Louis Rei: So to go back to that question where you asked, \"Did you know In2 was going to be a hit?\" - it's hard. As a musician, I can tell you that many times in the past I've said, \"Yeah, this is the song that everyone's going to like,\" and it just didn't happen. How did you come up with the name WSTRN? Louis Rei: It was actually our manager, Morgan Keyz. The music scene has its poster boys - East London had Dizzee Rascal, etc - so we're saying it's the West's turn now. Is there a focal point for the music scene in West London? Akelle: Everything's run by social networks now. You don't need a hook-up or a meet-up to create a scene. But there's so much more talent to come. We're bringing West London together. And it's divided. There's not much unity. In what way is it divided? Louis Rei: What's unique about West London is you can walk down a lovely high street and you'll take a turn and suddenly you're on a council estate. So you'll have friends from different walks of life. Akelle: It's a proper eye-opener. Louis Rei: You just get to experience things from a different viewpoint. It rounds you as a person. Isn't it easy to become resentful when you're right next to people who have more than you? Louis Rei: I don't think we focus on who's got more than who. If you're doing well and I care for you, I'm happy - and I hope you feel the same about me. And then we elevate it. Other urban acts on the Sound of 2016 list - Section Boyz and J Hus - have done everything independently. Why did you decide to sign to a major label? Louis Rei: It's a difficult one. We started independently. We did the video for In2 and put it on YouTube ourselves. We generated ridiculous amounts of interest. But we went with Atlantic [Records] because we need a machine to take our music where we want it to go. We genuinely believe it can cross over. Akelle: We had to make a decision - and a quick decision at that. But we didn't just go with them in order to say \"yeah, we're on a label\". We checked out all the labels that was interested and went with the ones that felt genuine. How did they convince you? Akelle: They were thinking long-term. Other labels weren't thinking long-term. There's a perception that a major label will try to impose its vision on you. How do you stay true to yourselves? Akelle: That's something we had to talk about. We know about the industry through experience - so we're not going to be puppets. So what happens next? Louis Rei: Just making more music. Haile: We've got so much sick tunes already - but we're going to make more. Because we might make a better tune that we want on the album. How many songs have you got? Akelle: So many. Louis Rei: Enough for an album. Akelle: Maybe two. Louis Rei: Everybody seems to feel like, \"do you feel pressure after In2?\" but we're really enjoying it. How can you feel negative? We started at zero, we're here now and if it stays here, it's a bonus."}
{"text": "Data from NHS England showed in September the health service missed its A&E target to see, treat or discharge patients within four hours. Performance also fell short on access to cancer treatment, diagnostic tests and ambulance response times. To make matters worse, hospitals have been struggling to get patients out when they are ready to leave. A snapshot taken on the last Thursday of September showed more than 5,000 patients in England were occupying beds, even though they could have been discharged. This was the worst level since records began in 2010 - with the rise in delays over the past few months largely driven by problems accessing social care services, such as help in the home. Elsewhere in the UK, the NHS has been struggling as well with the four-hour A&E targets being missed everywhere. Scotland is performing the best. On almost every measure, the NHS in England is in a worse position than this time last year. And as we enter winter, that spells bad news: last year's was the worst for a generation with A&E waits hitting their highest levels since targets were introduced in 2004. But the pressures are now spreading more to other parts of the system. Once in hospital, doctors are finding it difficult to discharge patients because the support services in the community needed for the most vulnerable are not available. Waits for diagnostic tests are lengthening and the key cancer target has been missed for well over a year. Even on routine treatment - hips and knees - the signs are not good. The target is being met, but on the current trajectory it will be missed by the end of the year. The weather may be mild, but winter has come early for the NHS. Read more from Nick Alarm as patients 'shun flu jab' NHS deficits hit a 'massive' £930m The monthly data for England also showed: However, there were some measures the NHS in England did meet. In total six of the eight cancer targets were achieved, while the 18-week target for patients to be seen for non-emergency operations such as knee and hip replacements was met. Health secretary Jeremy Hunt told the BBC: \"The NHS frontline is under a huge amount of pressure at the moment but we have a very good plan put together by the NHS being backed by the government financially on the back of a strong economy and, as we implement that plan, we're confident we can turn these numbers around.\" He added: \"Winter is always a difficult period for the NHS but staff are working incredibly hard on the frontline right now and we should remember that even despite that pressure nine out 10 people are being seen, treated and discharged within four hours.\" The rising problems come as junior doctors are being balloted on industrial action over a dispute with government about their new contract. The result of that vote is expected next week and could lead to 35,000 junior doctors walking out as winter hits with three dates - 1, 8 and 16 December - put forward by the British Medical Association on Thursday. The NHS is also under pressure to save money with figures for the first three months of this financial year showing overspending has hit nearly £1bn - more than the total for the whole of the previous year. Dr Mark Holland, the president of the Society for Acute Medicine, said this was creating the \"perfect storm\". He added: \"There is already talk of putting ambulances on divert, of taking patients to other hospitals. \"That intensity is beginning to creep up. Not on a day-to-day consistent basis like last December and January, but it's starting and it feels like it is occurring a wee bit too early. \"The question this winter is how resilient we will be and what will be the tipping point. And that is the unknown factor which is very, very worrying.\" Shadow health secretary Heidi Alexander said it looks like it will be the \"most difficult winter for 30 years\". She added: \"There is now clear evidence that the cuts to social care are not only devastating for the lives of vulnerable older people, but are having a knock-on effect on the NHS.\" An NHS England spokeswoman said the health service was coping well given the context as it was seeing a \"record number\" of patients. \"Nobody could argue there isn't ongoing pressure on the NHS but despite this, it is delivering a good service for the vast majority of patients,\" she added. Meanwhile, the British Medical Association has released details of the days industrial action could take place. The union said it wanted to give as much notice as possible to avoid disruption for patients. Follow Nick on Twitter"}

The French side beat the Warriors with the last kick of the game after scoring just two tries. That means a 5-1 or 4-0 match points win for the Dragons in France would be enough to see them through. They also have a slim chance of being one of the best runners-up with a narrow win. They took maximum points in Pau on the way to the semi-final in 2015-16, as well as gaining a maximum away to Stade Francais the previous season when they also reached the last four. \"Personally I have no fears about it, Brive are a good side and it's a very tough environment, but Pau, Stade Francais, the list goes on and (I've won) with other teams at Castres and Biarritz,\" Jones said. \"Particularly with this team we've got a style of rugby that can cause Brive some problems. \"We've got to deal with their power game.

{"text": "Southend looked comfortably cruising to victory against Uwe Rosler's promotion chasers after bossing the opening hour and going ahead towards the end of the first half through Anthony Wordsworth's opener. In Marc-Antoine Fortune the visitors had a towering target inside the Fleetwood box. He could easily have given Southend the lead before the half hour, getting on the end of Simon Cox's diagonal ball before Alex Cairns put in a full-stretch save to palm the ball away. Southend's pressure was made to count soon after as George Glendon's slip near the halfway line opened the door for Fortune and the big forward pulled it back for Wordsworth on the edge of the box, his effort striking the post and creeping under Cairns. Fleetwood might have struck back before the hour as Ball went on a perfectly-timed run - kept the ball in play and cut it back - but Conor McLaughlin's close-range header failed to beat Ted Smith in the Shrimpers goal. At the other end Jason Demetriou had claims for a penalty turned down when he appeared to be clipped by Cian Bolger. Fortune then could have sealed it, finding the arms of Cairns from barely five yards out. Southend boss Phil Brown made the decision to take his danger men out of the game and paid the price as a dramatic late twist handed the hosts a share of the spoils. A break down the left looked to have fizzled out, substitute Markus Schwabl recycling it to Ball on the edge of the box and his blast into the top-left corner was too good for Smith.

{"text": "Spurs plan to redevelop their current White Hart Lane ground to accommodate a new 56,250-capacity venue. North London rivals Arsenal moved to a new £400m stadium themselves in 2006. \"If you look at English clubs who have built a new stadium and look at where they have finished, then it tells you how difficult it is,\" said Wenger. The Gunners have only recently begun to reap the benefits of the switch to the self-funded 60,000-capacity Emirates from Highbury, after years of having to set aside significant funds against a long-term fixed interest rate repayment bond. During that time, Wenger was required to deliver Champions League football while also balancing the books. \"I knew always that would be the most sensitive period in the history of the club,\" he said. \"When we were in a position where we had to be in the Champions League just financially and you get into March/April and are like that (not in top four), the stress is terrible because you feel the future of the club is at stake and you have not a lot of margin (for error) - every point you lose can be dramatic.\" Tottenham say they are continuing \"discussions with multiple providers of finance\" in search of \"the optimum financing package for the project\". Recently, American investment company Cain Hoy has said it is no longer considering making an offer for the club. Wenger believes they will need an external cash injection to complete their stadium plans. \"If an owner comes in, and says 'look I put £400m to buy the stadium' it is easy,\" added the Frenchman. \"The way we did it is the hardest way, because we had no outside financial help and had to negotiate with the banks just to get the money at the start - and lets not forget we paid £120m just for the land. \"In the end we built the stadium for £400m, today it would cost £600m or up to £700m.\""}

Mr Smith said it would amount to at least an extra £1bn in total. He told the Jason Mohammad programme: \"Under Labour, in addition to setting this funding floor, because of the changes that we're introducing to the taxes system - we're going to be giving an extra £375m a year to Wales. \"Now work that out over the period - it is at least £1bn over the spending period.\" The Welsh Liberal Democrats' manifesto, launched on Wednesday, said the party's proposals for health and education in England would give Wales an extra £600m a year, which the Lib Dems said Welsh ministers should devote to the services concerned.

Women told me how the Brotherhood had won their backing by handing out free canisters of cooking gas. The rest is history. Mr Morsi went on to become president - only to be ousted from power by the military a year later following huge street protests. Many people from Awsim joined the counter demonstrations and several were killed when they were brutally crushed by the security forces. Some locals are among the thousands of Islamists who have been arrested. Now the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is not just banned, as it was for much of its eight decades of history in its country of origin - it is classed as a terrorist group. That makes life extremely risky for those in Awsim who remain staunch supporters. After Friday prayers, I meet a band of men who have been to four pro-Brotherhood rallies since the morning. \"The security forces have an iron grip now. When we go to the streets, they fire tear gas, bird shot and sometimes live ammunition,\" says Sayyid. Many Brotherhood leaders are on trial, charged with inciting violence. On Saturday, a court confirmed death sentences on the group's General Guide, Mohammed Badie, and others for planning attacks against the state. But another man, Ahmed, insists they have done nothing wrong. \"God willing, we'll see the democratic process get back on track soon,\" he says. Yet many in Egypt accept the clampdown on the Brotherhood, believing it failed its test in power, and across the entire region the fate of this relatively moderate Islamist organisation has undergone a dramatic turnaround. For a long time, its offshoots were the main political opposition in many Arab countries. Their social welfare projects helped them maintain strong grassroots. Then the uprisings of 2011 enabled them to emerge as key players in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya and Syria. That emboldened offshoots in Gulf states and some started to talk of a grand Islamist project. However such dreams were over quickly. Revolutions unravelled and ruling families in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia moved to check the Brotherhood's influence. Both nations have classified it as a terrorist organisation. There have been setbacks even in places where its position seemed most secure. In his smart villa in Amman, I sit with Abdullatif Arabiyat, as he sips a glass of lemon juice with mint. He is a veteran member of Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood and former leader of its political party, the Islamic Action Front. He was once speaker of parliament. Right now, he is deeply worried. After 70 years, his group has just split in two. A new, officially licensed branch defines itself as strictly Jordanian, saying it has cut ties to the regional movement, so it is not identified as militant. The legal status of the other, larger faction is less clear, but it is keeping its links to the wider Brotherhood. Mr Arabiyat, a lightly-bearded, dignified man, suggests that \"foreign factors\" have stirred up trouble in Jordan and that Jordanian security officials \"enhanced the conflict\". Not far away, in the Palestinian territories, Hamas - which is aligned to the Muslim Brotherhood - is also suffering from the organisation's demise. Its leaders were treated like VIPs in Egypt during the Brotherhood's brief reign. But in February, a court in Cairo joined Israel, the United States, the European Union and others in pronouncing Hamas a terrorist organisation. In Gaza, which is controlled by the political faction, ordinary people feel more isolated than ever. \"After Egypt's military coup the siege on Gaza has been tightened,\" says a policeman, Abu Zaher Qttawi. Mustafa, a student from the Islamic University of Gaza, says: \"We're saddened by the suffering of our Brothers in Egypt.\" \"The real terrorists are those who shoot dead peaceful demonstrators.\" Across Gaza, the green flags of Hamas still flutter defiantly above the mangled metal and rubble of homes destroyed in last summer's war with Israel. But throughout much of the Middle East, there is a sense that times are changing. And what worries many is that just as the Muslim Brotherhood, the grandfather of Islamist groups in the region, is in decline, so fanatical ones - like Islamic State - are gaining momentum. The danger is that efforts to suppress the Brotherhood could radicalise its younger supporters and help swell the ranks of the extremists."}

They laid flowers and a white teddy bear in tribute to Miss Godden-Edwards, who would have been 29 on Monday. She had been missing for eight years. Her remains were found in a field in Eastleach by police investigating the murder of 22-year-old Sian O'Callaghan. Taxi driver Christopher Halliwell, 47, of Ashbury Avenue, Swindon, has been charged with the murder of Miss O'Callaghan and is due to appear before Bristol Crown Court on Friday. Officers said at a news conference on Tuesday detectives would be questioning Mr Halliwell as part of their inquiries into Miss Godden-Edwards' disappearance. Mrs Edwards wrote on a card: \"When you were born and put into my arms, I cried with joy. \"I love you so much. But today I am crying for you, my beautiful girl. I loved you the day you were born and I love you even more today. \"I was always there for you, my baby girl, words can't be said about how I feel. Sleep tight my darling. Love Mum and Charlie.\" As the family paid their respects, they stood together with their arms around one another and hugged each other. They stayed at the field at Baxter's Farm for 15 minutes before driving away. Miss Godden-Edwards' family did not initially report her missing to the police as they thought she was living in the Bristol area.

{"text": "PM Malcolm Turnbull named the victim as Kai Hao. He was a 36-year-old newly married father, local media said. The gunman, Yacqub Khayre, also injured three police officers and took a woman hostage during the siege at an apartment building on Monday night. Khayre, 29, was shot dead by police after confronting them with a sawn-off shotgun. The hostage, a 36-year-old woman, was not physically harmed, authorities said. Police were investigating whether Khayre, a Somali-born Australian citizen, may have lured officers to the wealthy suburb of Brighton with the aim of ambushing them. Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton said Mr Hao was a building employee and \"in the wrong place at the wrong time\". Mr Ashton confirmed police had begun a terrorism investigation after Khayre made comments referencing so-called Islamic State and al-Qaeda. The siege has ignited debate about local parole laws after it emerged Khayre had a history of violence and was released from jail last year following an aggravated burglary. In 2009, he was acquitted over a foiled plot to attack a Sydney army barracks. The Australian government has said it will debate toughening parole laws later this week. \"I think the public are entitled to expect that people who present that level of danger to the public, and who have a terrorism background, there should be a presumption against bail or parole except in a very clear case,\" Attorney-General George Brandis told the ABC. However, the chairman of the Adult Parole Board said it was not informed Khayre was on a terror watch list. \"We had been told nothing about him that would indicate any suggestion of risk,\" Peter Couzens told Macquarie Radio. \"Had we been told, we would have acted.\" Last month, an Australian coroner criticised a decision which allowed bail to a gunman behind Sydney's deadly cafe siege in 2014."}
{"text": "The former officers have brought civil action against South Wales Police after being cleared of alleged corruption. The corruption trial collapsed in 2011. At the Cardiff court on Tuesday, senior Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) lawyer Gaon Hart said he stood by his advice that conviction was unrealistic. Former officers Graham Mouncher, Thomas Page, Richard Powell, John Seaford, Michael Daniels, Peter Greenwood, Paul Jennings and Paul Stephen are suing the force for misfeasance in public office and false imprisonment Mr Hart told the court how the relationship between him and the senior investigating officer and the Crown's lead counsel had deteriorated. He said he had been called perverse and verbose, that he had been patronised and had his intelligence insulted. Asked by Anthony Metzer QC, representing some of the officers, whether he was suggesting that the CPS should \"not embark on a prosecution that was flawed\" he answered: \"Yes\". He was asked about his concerns regarding the way officers conducted interviews in 1988 and whether it would be illegal now, or whether it was illegal then. \"I was concerned that if the officers said 'that's how we did it in those days' it would make proving conspiracy more difficult,\" Mr Hart said. \"Because if all of them independently had taken illegal action, that's not a conspiracy.\" The case is continuing."}
{"text": "Ms Kong and her husband Ha Wai Kay had the same routine every day. They would wake up before dawn and journey to their roast meat shop to start the day's cooking. Drawing on a secret recipe inherited from his father, Mr Ha would be in the kitchen taking care of roasting the pork and duck, while his wife would prepare the front of house. From around 11am, customers would start pouring into their modest eatery and would keep coming until closing time after sunset. Mr Ha started out roasting meat in a small stall in Singapore's Chinatown, but over time the business grew and they moved to a small shop, naming the Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint. In 2012, at almost 70 years old they decided it was time to retire. But it was only two years later that their fortunes suddenly changed. In October, a Singapore conglomerate, Aztech, paid $3m (4m Singapore dollars) for their business. And it was largely because of their secret roast meat recipe. Aztech's founder Michael Mun had tried Kay Lee's roast meat and decided that if he liked it so much then there was a good chance many more people would too. \"We usually have management meetings over lunches,\" says Michael's son Jeremy, vice president of marketing at Aztech, \"and one of the senior managers mentioned this shop was up for sale.\" Hoping it was onto a winner, Aztech bought Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint. Besides the family recipe, the value of the land the roast meat shop was sitting on was also important. Aztech offered the couple $370,000 more than their original asking price because land prices had risen significantly during the intervening period. Aztech which is also a family business specialises in electronics, and LED lighting. More recently its moved into food distribution and says it has big plans for the roast meat business. There are now two outlets for the Kay Lee Roast Meat brand. Aztech has also invested in a new centralised kitchen, where all the cooking is done before the food is transported to the various outlets. As part of the sale agreement, Mr Ha and his wife remain temporarily employed by Aztech, to train the new staff on ways to perfect their family recipe. Singaporeans love their food. They can spend hours debating on the best places on the island to go to for their favourite dishes, ranging from the spiciest laksa (noodles in coconut broth), to the tastiest of chilli crabs. Many families dine out at least once a week, often at small restaurants that focus largely on selling staple food dishes. Aztech's purchase of Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint has raised the hopes of others in the food industry yearning for a break. At The Bedok Marketplace, a newly renovated hawker centre to the east of Singapore there is a small stall called  Uncle Chicken Rice, operated by a second-generation food business owner Niven Leong. His prized chicken rice recipe was also handed down from his father, who started out with a small food stall in 1971 in one of Singapore's residential estates. Mr Leong's family recipe is on the market as well, for around $32,000. It is a price tag includes training and a handover process. He is pinning his hopes on finding a passionate, enthusiastic and energetic \"hawkerpreneur\" (the local term given to an entrepreneur working in one of Singapore's many hawker centres) to take over the business. \"I think if they can see the potential in our chicken rice my job is done - my father's legacy can carry on,\" says Mr Leong. He says that he and his wife do not have children. \"We don't have someone to pass this on to and it would be a great pity if this recipe is gone.\" Carrying on this kind of family legacy is easier said than done.  Generally, Singapore's younger generation is not keen to spend long hours cooking over a hot stove for little financial reward, when there's money to be made elsewhere. Yet Mr Leong is confident that he has one of Singapore's best chicken rice recipes and remains optimistic that one day someone will come along who shares his passion. Until that day he says he'll keep selling his chicken rice seven days a week, just as his father did before him. As for Betty Kong and Ha Wai Kay, they are looking forward to retiring - as soon as they've passed on all their trade secrets to Kay Lee Roast Meat Joint's new owners."}
{"text": "The Orthodox Church has long had close links to the Kremlin. And during Russia's stand-off with the West over Ukraine that relationship has only grown stronger. On 14 August a radical group called God's Will raided an exhibition of Soviet-era underground art at the Manezh hall, near the Kremlin. They especially objected to avant-garde depictions of Jesus Christ and Orthodox saints - a video posted online showed them throwing exhibits onto the floor and shouting \"You can't offend Christ like that!\" Some compared that with the destruction of ancient statues by Islamist militants, but some also accused the government of deliberately creating an atmosphere of impunity for Orthodox extremists such as God's Will leader Dmitry Enteo. \"Unless the state immediately isolates him, this will mean either that the state itself is criminal and shares his criminal beliefs, or that there is no state any more,\" wrote independent journalist Viktor Shenderovich. The head of Russia's world-famous Hermitage Museum, Mikhail Piotrovsky, deplored the attack, saying \"our society is sick\". Dmitry Enteo was released after questioning. In 2012 the Kremlin and the Orthodox Church jointly condemned the punk band Pussy Riot for their \"punk prayer\" inside Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral, in which they crudely mocked Church support for Mr Putin. Three of the participants were each sentenced to two years in jail. Many other groups in Russia have joined the conservative chorus led by government and Church figures. Some of the most vocal are affiliated with the traditional Cossack movement. In 2014, a group of Cossacks whipped Pussy Riot members as they were about to perform another song critical of Mr Putin. Hundreds of Cossack militants from Russia are also fighting for the rebels against Ukrainian government troops and volunteers in eastern Ukraine. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, in March 2014, the Orthodox Church has played a key role in the Russian propaganda campaign. Orthodox rhetoric is now widely used by TV commentators and state officials. One such idea - \"the Russian world\" - originally denoted the community of Russian speakers worldwide, but has now become a buzzword justifying Russia's policy towards Ukraine. People are being killed in Ukraine for considering themselves \"part of the Russian world\", Russian MP Leonid Kalashnikov said in a typical comment. And on a controversial visit to Russian-annexed Crimea, on 17 August, Mr Putin said: \"I consider Russians and Ukrainians generally to be one people\". The Russian Orthodox Church's representative in Ukraine is Metropolitan Onufriy. His official title is head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate. Since his enthronement in August 2014, Metropolitan Onufriy has been critical of the Kiev government's campaign against the separatists, rejecting Ukraine's European aspirations as a \"tragedy\". Onufriy refused to stand up when the parliament in Kiev honoured Ukrainian fighters involved in the conflict - prompting the Kiev-based daily Den to say that \"he is more afraid of Putin than God\". This convergence of views between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Kremlin comes despite a constitutional provision that is supposed to keep them apart. Since Vladimir Putin's return to power in 2012, the Church has become visible in practically all spheres of public life in Russia, from charity drives to science and the army. Pictures of Orthodox priests blessing new weapons and even space rockets have drawn much criticism from online commentators. Alexander Yakovlev, a top Communist Party ideologue and functionary for many decades, said that the KGB \"directly ran\" the Orthodox Church and controlled all religious activity in the USSR. Many believe that the KGB's successor, the Federal Security Service (FSB), still has close links to top clerics. According to Alexander Dugin, a prominent Russian ideologue banned in Ukraine, Russia's role is to advocate conservatism as a weapon against the West's \"ultra-liberal values\" such as same-sex marriage. The clash of Western and traditional values goes back a long way in Russia. In the 19th Century, \"Westernisers\" argued bitterly with \"Slavophiles\" over Russia's future. And for most of the 20th Century, the Soviet Communist Party posed as the people's defender against the West's \"corrupting influence\". A rare avant-garde art exhibition was allowed in 1962, but it was quickly shut down after a visit by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. \"The Soviet people do not need all this,\" was his verdict. More than 50 years later, the same artistic venue, Manezh, was raided by Dmitry Enteo and his God's Will followers. They also decided that Russians had no need for such art.

{"text": "LG has been announced as the first client to take advantage of the tie-up. Intel and ARM are often perceived as being rivals. Intel's x86 chip architecture dominates the PC sector while ARM-based chips are used in most phones and tablets. But the two said they expected the move to be \"mutually beneficial\". \"[I] am wowed by moments of cooperation that redefine the industry landscape,\" blogged Will Abbey, an executive at ARM. \"This agreement is one example of that and will deliver immense value to the design ecosystem and ultimately to our partners.\" Intel first began making processors for other semiconductor manufacturers just over three years ago. Its output included computer chips produced for a firm called Altera that incorporated some of ARM's technologies - Intel went on to acquire Altera last year. But the latest development marks a deeper relationship between Intel and ARM. The Californian firm said customers would be able to combine its ability to make 10-nanometre transistors - which promise performance gains over the existing 14nm tech currently used in high-end phone processors - and ARM's most advanced designs. ARM does not make physical products itself but instead licences its inventions to others, who then customise the designs. The partnership poses a challenge to Samsung, GlobalFoundries and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which currently manufacture most of the world's ARM-based processors. The move follows Intel's decision to cancel plans to release new Atom chips - processors of its own design created for mobile devices - and last month's announcement that Japan's Softbank is buying ARM for Â£24bn. \"This provides Intel an opportunity to become a bigger player in the mobile market by leveraging its leading-edge manufacturing capabilities,\" commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy. But he added that Intel now needed to sign up others beyond LG. \"Apple, for instance, relies on Samsung and TMSC to manufacture its chips. The fact it is willing to have more than one supplier could present an opportunity to Intel in the future.\""}

Stirling Council said the three initial projects had to the potential to generate more than £80m a year for the local economy and create 1,700 jobs. Part of the civic quarter development includes a square with an \"international\" visitor attraction. The council will hold a series of roadshows in the new year to outline the plans for UK and foreign investors, and the plans will also go on display across the Stirling area from January. Johanna Boyd, council Leader and chairwoman of the Stirling City Commission, said the development would help revitalise the city and the region and was about much more than infrastructure alone. \"We need to challenge ourselves to ensure that Stirling becomes a truly world-class city with benefits for all our citizens, particularly those most in need, and this is what the city development framework is designed to do,\" she said. \"It is as much about creating connections - linking rural and urban, enabling and working with our communities, and making sure that the entire Stirling area is a place of enterprise and opportunity for all.\" Further plans would include the regeneration of the Mercat Cross area of the city, a new conference centre and a new city park near the castle. Stewart Carruth, Stirling Council chief executive, said the plans were vital for Stirling to compete globally. \"Stirling compares well with other Scottish cities but our aspiration is to benchmark ourselves against the best in the world - cities like Stockholm that use their size, ambition and educational and technological assets to drive economic growth and generate wealth and prosperity for all their citizens,\" he said."}

{"text": "The claim: 1.7 million pensioners are living in poverty and a million in fuel poverty. Reality Check verdict: The figure for pensioners who are defined as living in poverty in the UK is a bit higher than that at 1.9 million. There isn't a specific figure for the number of pensioners in fuel poverty in the UK but a million is not an unreasonable estimate based on the figures that we do have. The Conservatives have not given any details of how they would apply a means test or how much they would hope to save. The winter fuel payment is between £100 and £300 (depending on your circumstances) paid to anyone receiving a state pension or people of pension age receiving certain other social security benefits. In winter 2015-16 it was paid to 12.2 million people, 42,000 of whom lived elsewhere in Europe. Kuenssberg: Labour cry foul over lack of Tory costings Pensioner heating curbs 'sick and sneaky' Mr McDonnell pointed out that since we don't know where the means test will fall, a number of less well-off pensioners could still lose the benefit. He suggested it might just be people entitled to pension credit who would get the fuel allowance, although government sources have told the BBC that would not be the mechanism, and that there would be a consultation process to decide how it would be tested. Pensioners with an income below £159.35 a week may claim pension credit - it's £243.45 for couples. According to the latest figures from November  there were 1.9 million people claiming pension credit, or 2.2 million if you include their partners, although there has been research suggesting that about one-third of people entitled to it are not claiming. Mr McDonnell told the BBC that there were 1.7 million pensioners living in poverty and a million living in fuel poverty. People count as living in relative poverty if they are in households with an income below 60% of the median household income. The median income is the one for which half of households have higher incomes and half have lower. The government's preferred measure of pensioner poverty is after housing costs have been taken into account. Nearly three-quarters of pensioners live in homes that are owned outright (compared with roughly one in five of the working-age population) and so are less likely to have high housing costs. On that measure, 16% of UK pensioners are in poverty, which is 1.9 million people. There are also measures of absolute poverty, which may measure whether people are able to afford a basic lifestyle - about 8% of pensioners fall below the threshold for material deprivation. To measure fuel poverty, the government looks at two things - how much you have to pay for fuel, and what your income is. You'll be considered to be in fuel poverty if your required fuel costs are above average and, were you to spend that amount, your remaining income would leave you below the official poverty line as explained above. The latest government figures we have on fuel poverty relate to 2014 and suggest 2.38 million households in total in England were in fuel poverty. There isn't a specific figure for the number of UK pensioners in fuel poverty, but according to Table 14 there were 621,000 households just in England in 2014 in which the oldest member was over 60. Age UK says this equates to more than 1 million individuals, although some of them will not yet be entitled to their state pension. Read more from Reality Check Follow us on Twitter"}
{"text": "Perhaps you recall the Virgin boss dipped in the briny when his balloon crashed off the coast of Ireland 29 years ago. To some of us - the less intrepid ones - it may have seemed like the hobby of a man with more money than sense. His interest in airships didn't get much beyond some very expensive advert hoardings. But as this Saturday marks the hundredth anniversary of a First World War Zeppelin airship raid on Edinburgh, it seems an appropriate moment to note that Branson's adventures are now having a spin-off with a lot of commercial potential. Market research points to sales of perhaps 600 airships over 20 years, with the oil industry as an early adopter. A small group of the people who worked with Richard Branson on those projects are still in the balloon and blimp business. This week they signed a letter of intent for their company, Straightline Aviation, to spend nearly half a billion dollars (Â£340m) on a 12-strong fleet of a new type of aircraft. The project is in hybrid aviation - a combination of helium balloon, covering roughly the area size of a football pitch, and some powerful aero-engines. And it has some interesting implications for the oil and gas industry, as well as renewable energy and tourism. Because new sources of fossil fuels are increasingly being sought in places off the beaten or metalled track, and because cost has become a big issue for the energy sector, hybrid aviation offers an alternative to building airports and roads. The airship designed by Lockheed Martin in California is designed to carry up to 20 tonnes of cargo and 19 passengers, and to deliver it, with a range of up to 1600 miles, at 70mph. It can land on sand, sea, in remote mountains or the remote ice and tundra of northern Canada and Alaska, where an airship removes the need to build ice roads each year. The hybrid airship uses hovercraft technology for a soft landing and a grip to the land or water. While being heavier than air, its four engines ensure it remains in position. And there are claims it can leave, tonne for tonne, only around a third of the carbon footprint of a fixed wing aircraft, and an eighth of a helicopter's. So the 20 tonne payload is only the start.  The US defence and technology giant has plans to push for a lifting capacity of 90 to 100 tonnes Another British company, based in Bedford, has reached prototype stage with a rival design.  Hybrid Air Vehicles, or HAV, first unveiled the Airlander 10 two years ago. If you join in crowd-funding it - and around 1000 people came up with another Â£500,000 only last week - you can join the Airlander Club and get a hard-hat tour of the hangar it currently occupies. Getting to its maiden flight has taken longer than expected, but it could happen within weeks. At 92 metres (300 feet), Airlander 10 looks and floats more like a conventional airship, with powerful positioning engines. For now, it is aimed more at passenger transport. You can probably imagine the potential for sightseeing in tourism honeypots. Along with the heavier-lift Airlander 50 design, it has other potential and very significant uses.  It could be adapted to stay at high altitude for up to five days, providing military surveillance and airborne co-ordination, or up to 21 days in its unmanned mode. Or it could monitor movements across a border (saving Donald Trump a lot of dollars over the big Mexican wall he's planning as president). Military deployment was where the project began more than ten years ago. Much of the HAV funding came from the US Government, where the US Army wanted a Long-Endurance Multi-Intelligence Vehicle. However three years ago, Pentagon funding was withdrawn as President Obama and Congress battled over the government budget ceiling. So HAV went out to research markets beyond US Army orders, and concluded in 2014 that there could be demand for 600 airships over 20 years. Northern North America is where Straightline Aviation intends to locate the first of its 12 Lockheed Martin airships.  The Wolverhampton outfit is led by long-time balloon and airship enthusiasts, drawn together in Sir Richard Branson's stable of airborne adventurers, led by chief executive Mike Kendrick. This week's letter of intent was signed while Lockheed Martin seeks regulatory clearance for the aircraft. The first of its production run is due for delivery to Straightline in 2018. If the Midlands company gets lucky, that could be around the time that the current sharp cuts in oil and gas exploration lead to a supply crunch, and a rise in the price of energy. And while there's a lot of northern forest and tundra to be explored in North America, there are also remote Middle East deserts and south-east Asian islands. And the recent big finds in oil and gas have been off the coasts of Africa, which offer the industry huge potential but not much infrastructure. If not for oil and gas, the hybrid airship could offer opportunities for renewable energy - getting turbines offshore or onto hilltops without the need for expensive road infrastructure or helicopter lifts. Or it could transport solar panels into the desert. The chief operating officer of Straightline Aviation, Mark Dorey, cites a striking statistic that half the world's population is not connected by road. So connecting them by air, this new take on inflation floats big possibilities for commercial, economic and development benefits."}
{"text": "Abel Hernandez put the home side in the lead from the penalty spot after Harry Maguire was fouled by Lee Peltier. Sam Clucas did well to convert Mohamed Diame's cross on the volley for Hull's second in the second half. Both Hernandez and Clucas had further chances, but the win takes Hull past Derby into second, five points behind Middlesbrough. The defeat will put more pressure on Cardiff manager Russell Slade, who was reportedly close to the sack after the weekend's FA Cup exit by League One strugglers Shrewsbury. The result rarely looked in doubt, especially after Anthony Pilkington clipped over Cardiff's best chance midway through the first half. Five minutes before half-time, Peltier wrestled man of the match Maguire to the ground from a corner, and Hernandez blasted the penalty beyond David Marshall's reach. But manager Steve Bruce was not impressed with his player's reaction. He said: \"I think 10 people had come over from Uruguay. Abel jumped into the crowd, and picked a yellow card, which was a bit silly, to say the least.\" Clucas added Hull's second, doing well to control a low volley from Diame's cross. Marshall was kept busy, twice denying Clucas a chance to get his second, as Hull secured their 10th home win of the season. Hull City manager Steve Bruce: Media playback is not supported on this device \"It was comfortable. On another night, it could have been three or four. \"We've been fantastic at home, with one defeat in the last 18. We've got another home game at the weekend - can we put more pressure at the top of the table? \"We're not that clinical, though, which is disappointing. It's our Achilles heel. We can't keep creating five, six or seven opportunities and only take one or two.\" Cardiff manager Russell Slade: \"We know what we've got to do. It's time to roll our sleeves up and get it done. Of course I am [confident of getting into the play-offs]. I believe in what I'm doing. \"I've done 750 games with a win ratio of around 39% so it doesn't mean I'm a mug. It means I'm capable and I still feel I'm capable of getting this team in the top six.\" On reports he may get the sack: \"I don't know where all that kind of information comes from or what sources that is. As far as I'm concerned, the dialogue with the chairman and chief executive is very good and we're all wanting the same thing.\" Match ends, Hull City 2, Cardiff City 0.

{"text": "Last night, the former chief executive of Torquing Group - the firm behind the Zano - resigned. That left the thousands who had backed the firm with more than £2m a year ago in despair. Ivan Reedman, the engineer driving the design of the mini-drone, explained why he was going in a post on a Zano forum. \"My resignation is due to personal health issues and irreconcilable differences,\" he wrote. Reedman, who stepped down as chief executive to become R&D director last year after new investors bought into the business, had been the only executive to engage with worried backers over recent months. \"To say I am devastated pales when compared to what I am feeling,\" his statement said. Those who had backed the project reacted with sadness. \"Fingers crossed Zano can continue,\" wrote one backer, \"for the benefit of everyone (including me) that has invested their hard-earned money.\" But many of the more than 12,000 backers have already despaired of receiving what they were promised in Zano's Kickstarter campaign. Its promotional video showed the tiny drone following a mountain bike down a wooded path, and a cliff diver plunging into the sea, all the while capturing high-quality video. But when I visited the Zano team in Pembroke Dock, south west Wales in August, it was already clear that the project was in trouble. I got the first demonstration of the drone and it was not impressive, staying airborne for only a few minutes, colliding with walls, and delivering very poor video. Reedman promised that these problems would be ironed out with later software upgrades, and that the priority was to start delivering the device to backers. Since then, some backers have received their drones. But as far as I can see, none has been happy. \"Give me back my money, let me put it towards a drone that works,\" was one comment on a Zano Facebook forum. An American backer wrote about the frustrations of flying the drone compared with what was promised in the promotional video. \"Follow me... Hold position... Gesture control... Return to base... all claims on the Kickstarter Campaign video,\" he wrote. \"So, how close are they? Seems like most people are pleading with them to send one that flies... Jeez!\" Anger mounted as Torquing Group started sending Zanos to people who had paid to pre-order them before those who had backed the Kickstarter project. That was seen as a betrayal to backers who could not get a refund. By contrast, pre-order customers were getting their money back if they cancelled. \"Sending Zanos out to pre-order customers before backers was a huge mistake in my opinion,\" one backer, David Black told me. \"The backers were the people that brought this project to life and should have been Torquing's priority. \"Sending to pre-orders seems to show a lack of respect to backers and Kickstarter in general.\" Some attacked Kickstarter itself, saying the crowdfunding platform should not have allowed the project to go ahead without checking that the promotional video gave a true picture of the product. \"I will never invest in a Kickstarter again,\" wrote Ashley Hall on a forum. \"You save a small amount of money but ultimately you end up with a partially completed beta product.\" Earlier this month I contacted Reece Crowther, Torquing's marketing manager. I asked a number of questions about the project and its failure to deliver what had been promised, but received no response. Last night, after news of Reedman's resignation emerged, I got in touch again. This time Crowther did respond, but only to say this: \"We will be releasing an official statement in the next 48 hours to address the recent resignation of Ivan Reedman. We are still digesting this news internally and we are in a state of shock at present.\" So, Zano's army of backers will have to wait a while to find out what happens next. It is safe to say that many, if not most, have already given up on what now looks like Europe's most disastrous Kickstarter project."}
{"text": "After a short silence two men gingerly raise their hands. In towns and cities across South Africa, small groups of men, some of them confessed rapists, are meeting to talk about sexual violence, as part of a small but significant challenge to their country's notorious record on rape. This workshop is gathered at a sports centre in the deprived Johannesburg township of Alexandra. \"Most men are silent about this,\" says Dumisani Rebombo, who is leading the workshop organised by the One Man Can Campaign. But it is \"vitally important\" for men to play their part in tackling the rape crisis, he says. Just as the participation of white people in the black struggle against apartheid in South Africa had added strength to that movement, men \"must stand up and work with women\" to combat rape, he told the BBC World Service. \"Do you think women are raped in our country because of wearing short skirts?\" Mr Rebombo asks the group. They reply with a mix of Yes and No - the Yes group a little louder than the other. \"Rape is about sleeping with a woman without her consent and I have done it,\" admits one of the men, 33-year-old Phikeleli. \"By coming here I have had the opportunity to sit down with other men and to discuss the issue of 'No is No' - and to understand exactly what rape is,\" he adds. Another man told the BBC about a gang rape of a woman in his neighbourhood. \"The community said that she deserved it... It happens so often that it is not taken seriously by the community - it's a norm to them.\" Though South Africa's murder rate has now fallen to its lowest level in recent years, rape is  still on the increase, according to the latest official crime figures. More than 56,000 women reported having been raped during the 12-month period to March 2011, police say. Many more cases are believed to go unreported. Earlier this month President Jacob Zuma infuriated activists and many of the country's top lawyers by appointing an ordained pastor with controversial views on rape and homosexuality as the country's chief justice. Judge Mogoeng Mogoeng, now South Africa's most senior judge, has denied he was insensitive to rape. In 2004, however, he reduced the sentence of a man convicted of raping a seven-year-old girl from life imprisonment to 18 months, the minimum. And a year later, he reduced the jail sentence of another man who attempted rape from five to two years. In an interview with the BBC World Service, South Africa's Minister for Basic Education, Angie Motshekga, denied the authorities were doing too little to tackle the crime. The rate of rape cases is \"unacceptably high,\" says Mrs Motshekga. But she says \"the decadence in our society\" is to blame, not the government. \"Kids come to school with social stereotypes, which are reinforced at home, in society, in the church - everywhere they go. It is a social problem.\" \"How many people we arrest isn't the solution, it lies with socialisation and our country's value system.\" Dumisani Rebombo is himself a confessed rapist who went one step further by seeking out his victim years later, in order to ask for her forgiveness. He was 15 years old when he and another boy raped a girl in their village - \"in order to teach her a lesson\". He said it took him 20 years to realise what he had done was wrong. \"It dawned on me that I had to find this woman,\" he said. When they met, he apologised and she broke down in tears. Three years later, he began organising workshops to talk about how to stop other men raping women. \"I would say all men have in one way or another raped,\" says Ronnie, a former convict and another member at the workshop. Many of his fellow inmates were in jail for rape attacks. \"It's not easy for them to accept what they did was wrong,\" he says. \"It's all about power - men believe they have the right to do as they please.\" The issue of rape in South Africa was discussed on a special edition of the BBC World Service programme Newshour hosted by guest presenter, South African radio talk show host Redi Tlhabi.

{"text": "The GMB said the refusal by a security company to sign a union agreement was against Labour's rules. It is calling on the party to find an alternative contractor for next month's event to avoid it being \"scuppered\". The company, Showsec, said it was \"not anti-unions in any way\" and Labour sources said they were confident the conference would go ahead as planned. But a Labour spokesman said: \"We do not comment on commercial arrangements.\" The BBC understands the party has not yet signed a contract with a security provider for the conference, which begins on 25 September. But it has rejected newspaper claims the Home Office could shut down the four-day event, at Liverpool's Arena and Conference Centre, if Labour fails to sort out its own security, with Labour sources saying the conference is a \"private event\". Labour approached Showsec after the party's National Executive Committee voted last year to boycott G4S, which has provided security at party political conferences in the UK for some years. It was prompted by claims by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign that G4S was linked to \"Israeli prisons which hold Palestinian political prisoners from occupied Palestinian territory inside Israel\". The UK's main party conferences are held inside secure zones, with airport-style security scanners to screen the thousands of attendees. Three security companies are reported to have declined a contract with Labour before it invited Showsec to tender. Roger Jenkins, GMB national officer for the security industry, said: \"This is by no means sorted. \"We have repeatedly asked Showsec to agree to sign up to a standard recognition agreement that recognises GMB to negotiate pay and conditions, seeing its workers treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. \"The clock is ticking fast ahead of next month's conference and the company's continued refusal to recognise GMB is intolerable.\" He added: \"If Showsec continues to show such disregard for unions then it has proven itself totally unsuited to the task of providing security for this event - and the Labour Party leadership must immediately put an alternative in place to avoid the conference being scuppered.\" Mr Jenkins also told The Guardian Labour rules stipulated that \"any service provider they use have to have a recognition agreement with a trade union\". In a statement, Showsec said: \"We were invited to tender for the security provision at the Labour Party conference, but at no point were we advised that signing a recognition agreement with the GMB Union was a stipulation of that tender. \"Showsec are not in a position to sign this recognition agreement due to corporate governance guidance, but contrary to some reports, we would like to make it clear that the company are not anti-unions in any way. \"We have, in fact, had a partnership agreement in place with GMB Union since 2004, but following discussions with the union in an attempt to find a resolution, they have advised us that this is no longer fit-for-purpose. \"We are disappointed that we presently find ourselves in this position.\""}
{"text": "Priebke was jailed for life in 1998 for his role in the WWII massacre of 335 Italians at Rome's Ardeatine Caves. But because of his age and poor health, he was allowed to serve his sentence under house arrest in the capital. The move caused anger over what some people in the city regarded as conditions that were far too comfortable and lenient. Priebke was one of the SS officers present during the killing of men and boys at the caves in 1944, in a reprisal attack ordered by Adolf Hitler for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters. He was among the officers who oversaw the operation to round up victims and transport them to a network of caves on the outskirts of the city where they were all shot. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In July, an association representing families of some of the victims of the massacre renewed calls for Priebke to \"find the courage to ask for forgiveness\". He was extradited to Italy in 1994 after he was discovered working as a school teacher in Argentina. He was tracked down by an American journalist working for ABC News and admitted in an interview his role in the massacre. Priebke's lawyer, Paolo Giachini, said on Friday that he had left a final video interview as his \"human and political testament\", but it was unclear what it contained and when it would be released. Priebke, who had been living in his lawyer's apartment in Rome, was allowed to do his own shopping, go for walks in the park and go out to restaurants in the evening to eat with friends."}
{"text": "He is credited with helping achieve economic growth after the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime, responsible for one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century. But the prime minister, 60, is also seen as an authoritarian figure with a poor human rights record and the resources to thwart any real political challenge. He shows no signs of wanting to relinquish power - in May he said he wanted another decade at the top. His ruling Cambodia People's Party (CPP) is expected to dominate elections on 28 July 2103, most likely extending his leadership, despite the return of opposition leader Sam Rainsy. Born into a peasant family in 1952, Hun Sen was educated by Buddhist monks in Phnom Penh. In the late 1960s, he joined the Communist Party, and for a while he was even a member of the Khmer Rouge - although he denies accusations that he was any more than an ordinary soldier. He lost his left eye during an exchange of gunfire and he has reportedly said he can only see a limited distance. During Pol Pot's tyrannical regime in the late 1970s, under which as many as two million people died, Hun Sen fled to Vietnam to join troops opposed to the Khmer Rouge. When Vietnam installed a new government in Cambodia in 1979, he returned as minister of foreign affairs, becoming prime minister in 1985 at the age of 33. Hun Sen lost the 1993 elections, but he refused to accept the results and forced a negotiation to become second prime minister alongside the Funcinpec Party's Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He went on to seize power in a bloody coup in 1997, forcing Prince Ranariddh to temporarily leave the country. The CPP won general elections in 2003 but did not have two-thirds majority, so it struck a deal with Funcinpec in 2004, ending almost a year of political deadlock. Hun Sen was re-elected prime minister by parliament in July 2004. In Cambodia's 2008 elections the CPP won most of the contested seats. But the polls were criticised by international monitors, with the EU saying the ruling party made \"consistent and widespread\" use of state resources for its own campaign. Rights groups have also regularly criticised the country's human rights situation. \"The human rights situation in Cambodia deteriorated markedly in 2012 with a surge in violent incidents, as the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) prepared for national elections,\" Human Rights Watch said. At least 35 rights activists \"opposing land grabs and demanding better working conditions were killed, wounded, arbitrarily arrested, threatened with arrest, or kept in exile by CPP-led security forces and the CPP-controlled judiciary\". Ahead of these elections, Hun Sen faced calls from the US to allow his main rival, Sam Rainsy, to return. A royal pardon was subsequently granted to Mr Rainsy, who had been living abroad after being jailed in absentia on charges he said were politically motivated. Mr Rainsy returned to Cambodia but remains unable to run in the polls on a technicality. And observers say that the conditions for a fair election do not exist because of the CPP's tight control over the media, judiciary and other key state organs. Hun Sen has not campaigned for his re-election bid. \"I will not participate during the campaign. I don't want to face confrontation because during that time of year many people will criticise the CPP,\" he said. But in a speech in June he said Cambodians should keep the polls from \"breaking our nation, society, village and family\". \"I am calling on all of our people and officials not to retaliate to acts of insulting [from opposition parties].\" \"If they insult us... you just kindly and politely respond: 'For me, I think the Cambodian People's Party is good because it saved people from the genocide regime of Pol Pot, rebuilds the country. I wonder if I have seen the opposition party has done anything for the country so far'.\""}

The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said inspectors were at the scene. Demolition work on the cinema began earlier this year. It is not yet known what caused the incident. Eyewitness Esther Beadle was at a bus stop directly opposite the building and described hearing a \"low rumble\" moments before the collapse. She said: \"The scaffolding got mangled and crumpled as it came down and there was dust everywhere. \"Had there been anyone on the other side of the street they would have been seriously injured.\" A HSE spokesman said: \"We have been made aware of this incident and inspectors are at the scene. \"As we are working with Newcastle City Council to ensure the site is as safe as possible, there is no further comment we can make at this stage.\" A Northumbria Police spokesman said: \"At around 23:30, police received a report that some of the scaffolding at the old Odeon cinema site had fallen down on to Pilgrim Street. \"Nobody was injured during the incident and the road was closed overnight to allow the scaffolding to be cleared away. \"The road was reopened at around 6.30am this morning.\" A Newcastle City Council spokesman added: \"The former Odeon cinema has been under demolition since January as part of the regeneration of the wider area. \"The facade of the building, which was scaffolded, collapsed at about 11.30pm last night and police closed the road.

{"text": "The Federal Court said the man, a photographer, should no longer possess naked photos and sex tapes, even if he had no intention of sharing them. The woman had originally agreed to the images but this consent stopped when the relationship ended, the court said. Germany has some of the strictest privacy laws in Europe. The Federal Court was called upon to rule in a dispute between a former couple, who were arguing over whether or not the man should delete intimate photos and videos. In its ruling (in German), the court said everyone had the right to decide whether to grant insight into their sex life - including to whom they grant permission and in what form. It said that by retaining the images, the photographer had a certain \"manipulative power\" over his ex-lover. He should no longer have rights to the photos and videos once the relationship had ended, it concluded. It is not clear how the ruling will be enforced. Recent cases of naked images being leaked online have sparked a debate about victims' rights, with some countries making so-called \"revenge porn\" a criminal offence. Commenting on the Federal Court ruling, German lawyer Katja Weber said two important points had to be established in such cases: She said \"intimate\" photos were not exclusively those taken before, during or after sex. However, \"that was the type of photo considered in this case\", she said. \"One can imagine plenty of situations where, during a relationship, compromising photos might be taken. \"Even, for instance, photos showing one's partner minus some clothes can be categorised as intimate shots, which should therefore be deleted.\" Consent for having the pictures taken does not have to be written - it can be verbal, the lawyer added. If someone maintains that their ex-partner was willing for the photos to be used after the end of the relationship, that consent would still have to be proven, according to the new ruling, Ms Weber argued."}
{"text": "The men sexually assaulted the victim as she was driven around Coventry in January 2016 after promising her a lift home after a night out. They then drove to a location where she was repeatedly raped. Calin Lacatus, Timotei Baran and Constantin Vila were convicted of rape and sexual assault after a three-week trial at Warwick Crown Court. Lacatus, 28 of Beake Avenue, Coventry, was jailed for 10 years for three counts of rape and one of sexual assault. More updates on this story Baran, 21 of no fixed abode, was sentenced to nine years for two counts of rape and one of sexual assault. Vila, 28 of Victory Road, Coventry, was jailed for eight years for rape and sexual assault. The woman had been at Grosvenor Casino and met Lacatus outside after leaving at about 23:00 GMT, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said. After a conversation, he agreed to give her a lift home and as she got into his Volkswagen Golf, the two other men joined them. After being repeatedly sexually assaulted and then raped by the three men, the woman managed to escape and called a friend who drove her back to the casino where they contacted police. Jonathan Kelleher, from West Midlands Crown Prosecution Service's rape and serious sexual offences unit, said: \"These defendants are dangerous sexual predators who preyed on a vulnerable woman. \"They subjected the victim to a horrendous sexual assault after luring her into their car under the pretence of giving her a lift home. \"We would like to take this opportunity of commending the victim for her support and helping us to bring these three men to justice.\""}
{"text": "Some are forced to go to food banks. Others, though, are growing their own. Nigel McKinney is one of them. Back in April he transformed a piece of rough ground at the back of his house outside Kilcoo, County Down, into a fruit and vegetable garden. There are now 10 raised beds full of produce. He wouldn't claim to be an expert, but he is delighted with what he has grown so far. \"We have rhubarb, chard, sprouts, runner beans, sweet corn, onions, parsley and celery,\" said Nigel. \"I like food and you can't eat anything else. \"I have always tried to grow little bits of salad and when you have a bit of space as we have here, it seems a real pity not to put it to productive use. \"Out in the garden you are working, it clears the head and you get to enjoy the fruits of it.\" Nigel is a member of the Grow It Yourself organisation, which was founded in Waterford by Michael Kelly in 2009. There are now over 30,000 people involved and over 100 GIY groups across Ireland. Nigel organised a public meeting in Newcastle with a view to setting up a group for south Down. More than two dozen people turned up eager to listen and learn. The guest speaker was GIY Ulster Champion Michael McEvoy. \"There is at least one group in every county in Ireland, north and south,\" he said. \"People come together on a monthly or seasonally or online to share information, learn from each other or support each other.\" To mark the winter solstice, established GIYers, as they are called, from Belfast and north Down gathered on a farm outside Bangor. Heather Boyd belongs to the Lisburn group. She has been growing her own food in back garden for years. \"It's great fun and there's nothing beats the pleasure of seeing something come on from seed and then going out and actually picking it and cooking it,\" she said. \"I've grown potatoes and onions, sweet corn, courgettes, lettuce, salad and tomatoes.\" \"It can be very difficult. You will have success and failures, but it is very rewarding and it makes you appreciate the food and the effort that goes into it.\" For Noelle Robinson from the Bangor GIY group, it is more than just the food. \"Everybody enjoys the company. They have common interests. They enjoy discussing growing things, swopping ideas and swopping seeds as well,\" she said. The consensus at the gathering is GIY groups bring people in a way that they would never meet each other anywhere else. Growing your own food may not save you a trip to the supermarket but it could help to cut costs. It might involve some hard work however there will be free food at the end of it."}
{"text": "Google published details of the yet-to-be-fixed bug on Monday after giving Microsoft a week to react. Google said the issue was \"particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited\". But Microsoft said the alert could do more harm than good at this point because it needs more time to develop a patch. \"We believe in co-ordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today's disclosure by Google puts customers at potential risk,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told the VentureBeat news site. The flaw involves a file called Win32k.sys, which the operating system requires to display graphics. It should not be deleted or otherwise altered by users because doing so can cause system errors that result in the so-called \"blue screen of death\". However, Google outlines a way hackers can exploit the file to cause a \"security sandbox escape\", meaning that once it is compromised they can access and alter other unrelated computer functions to cause problems. Since 2013, Google has operated a policy of giving developers 60 days to fix a flaw it has identified if it does not believe anyone else is making use of it, but only seven days if it thinks it is being actively abused.

{"text": "A Rembrandt etching, from 1634, and a 1504 engraving by the German artist Durer were reported missing in April. They were found on Thursday in the library's print stacks by a conservation officer. \"We're thrilled to have found these treasures right here at home. They were found safe and sound, simply misfiled,\" said Library president Amy Ryan. Durer's Adam and Eve and Rembrandt's Self-Portrait With Plumed Cap and Lowered Sabre were found in the library's storage room, following an eight-week search of 320,000 items. Boston police, the FBI and the US attorney's office had been investigating the whereabouts of the artworks, whose combined estimated value was around $630,000 (Â£411,000), amid suggestions they had been stolen. 'Cloud lifted' Ryan, president of the Library since 2008, announced she was stepping down earlier this week. A damning audit - released last week - criticised the library, accusing it of ineffectual protection of special collections and disorganised storing of valuables. The same week saw the library announce that gold coins, apparently stored in a time capsule, may have gone missing decades ago. \"It's a cloud lifted, a burden off our shoulders,\" Ryan told the Boston Globe, following the discovery of the missing artworks on Thursday. \"Everyone is happy.\" \"Someone just said this to me and it's true: 'Nothing is missing under my watch'\". \"All the items that we have been told are missing - but that have not been verified - went missing years before I started at BPL [Boston Public Library].\" However, Ryan insisted she would still go ahead with her resignation on 3 July despite the good news. The Boston Public Library is the first municipally funded library in the United States and one of the first free public libraries in the world."}

That makes it $100 more expensive than Sony's PlayStation Vita and nearly double the cost of Nintendo's 3DS XL. One expert said Shield was unlikely to appeal to more than a \"niche audience\" but it would act as a showpiece for Nvidia's technology. The console is equipped with the firm's Tegra 4 chip - its new top-end mobile processor. The ARM-based component features 72 graphic processing unit (GPU) cores and four central processing unit (CPU) cores. Nvidia says this allows it to offer \"rich graphics and unbeatable performance\". The firm is pitching its chip as an alternative to Qualcomm's popular Snapdragon processors, which are used in high-end Android devices such as Samsung's Galaxy S4 and the HTC One. \"The market for handheld consoles is struggling in face of competition from smartphones, so the first question you have to ask yourself is what is the market for a dedicated Android gaming device,\" Ben Parfitt, online editor at games industry trade magazine MCV, told the BBC. \"Even if you believe a market exists, $349 is a lot of money. People aren't spending that at the moment on the Wii U which is a home console, I find it hard to believe they'd spend it on a handheld.\" Shield does offer features not found in either Sony or Nintendo's portable consoles. Its 5in (12.7cm) screen displays 720p high definition video; it has a more powerful speaker system; and its mini-HDMI port can output 4K resolution visuals to compatible televisions. In addition to running titles available from the Google Play and Tegrazone Android marketplaces, it can also stream more advanced titles bought from Valve's Steam platform and run on a wi-fi connected PC. \"These pieces, put together by a company full of gaming fanatics, add up to an amazing new open platform gaming portable,\" Nvidia said on its blog. After a hands-on test, the Techradar news site praised the variety of controls offered by the device, but noted that its 294 pixel per inch (ppi) resolution screen was outclassed by many smartphones. \"That was nothing to sneeze at a few years ago, but now your average smart phone is rocking ppi in the mid-300s,\" it said. \"The new HTC One has 440 ppi.\" Mr Parfitt also questioned the appeal of one of its other unique selling points. \"Streaming PC games is something you can't do on rival devices and that is a great feature,\" he said. \"But you have to have a compatible Nvidia graphics card in your PC - one of the reasonably new ones - so that will cut down the audience for that. And do the people who invest in high-end gaming on PCs want a portable as well? I don't know.\" Nvidia said Steam would ship with two titles optimised for the handheld: Sega's Sonic 4 Episode II, and Retrobomb's Expendable Rearmed. It added that it had started taking pre-orders from selected customers, and would open up sales to others from 20 May."}

{"text": "Some 800 jobs will move from Belfast to the former Shackleton Army barracks in Ballykelly. Sammy Wilson's concerns came to light after an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland's The View. But Agriculture Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was content with her decision. It is the latest twist in the executive's pledge to transfer civil service jobs west in a bid to redress an historic imbalance in investment, with government departments largely based in the greater Belfast area. The View found Mr Wilson was asked to approve a decision by the agriculture minister to over-rule advice from her permanent secretary and opt for Ballykelly, without further appraising other potential sites. Ms O'Neill's \"ministerial direction\" had to be approved by the finance minister. But it has emerged he, too, had concerns and, because the decision affected other departments, he brought the matter to the executive. It is understood Mr Wilson's concerns included the cost, staffing consideration and access to the former barracks site. However, in an interview with The View, Ms O'Neill said the Ballykelly site was ideal, was already owned by the executive and would regenerate the area. She said she was content with the process, which included an assessment of local council areas.  Limavady, near Ballykelly, came second in an internal departmental audit,  just behind Strabane. She said the executive had approved her decision to seek a business appraisal for Ballykelly. \"At the end of the day you would have wasted a lot of time going through all areas where the location was never going to happen so this was just a logical step for me,\" she said. What about the finance minister's concerns? \"I think I followed process,\" said Ms O'Neill. \"He (Mr Wilson) had voiced concerns. But that's ok. I'm content with the approach I've taken. I think it is a reasonable approach. I stand over it.\" Ms O'Neill said she hopes the trade union, NIPSA, which is seeking legal advice on the decision, will accept her explanation about why she opted for Ballykelly, before she began her Equality Impact Assessment. NIPSA has not yet ruled out a Judicial Review. Ballykelly is now in line for a multi-million pound investment, a boon for an area that has suffered a series of economic blows in recent years. Tina McCloskey, from Ballykelly Community Centre, said the closure of the army camp had been a really big blow for Ballykelly. She added:  \"Bringing these jobs and bringing these people here to Ballykelly and maybe people using the services in Ballykelly would be a good thing for us.\" Mrs McCloskey is among those pressing the Office of First and Deputy First Minister (OFMDFM) for a new community centre on the Ballykelly site which would provide services such as creche and catering facilities for workers. OFMDFM acquired the land from the Ministry of Defence in 2011 in another controversial decision. The MoD \"gifted\" the land to the executive but it came with a price tag, as it comes with millions of pounds in maintenance and clean-up costs. The site is partly on reclaimed land that is prone to flooding and some of it is contaminated with lead and other pollutants. Because of the costs, the OFMDFM accounting officer advised ministers it did not represent value for money. This led to a \"ministerial direction\" being issued by Peter Robinson and Martin McGuinness. John Dallat, who supported jobs coming to Ballykelly in his rural constituency, still has concerns about this initial decision. Commenting on the ministerial direction, he pointed out it is not done very often and only occurs where a senior civil servant cannot stand over a plan under civil service rules. He argued that more pressure should have been applied to the MOD to share the costs of clean-up, and maintenance. Jim Allister, the TUV leader and MLA for North Antrim, is among those asking questions, and complaining about the number of ministerial directions that have been invoked by the executive since 2007. Mr Allister told the BBC the Ballykelly case seems to be driven by political rather than economic considerations. He has tabled a number of questions about the number and nature of ministerial directions since 2007, questions the BBC has also put to the Department of Finance."}

It reports that turnout is expected to be high despite it being the second time voters have trudged to the polls in 10 months. From marking your choice on the ballot paper to charging Â£10 for a signature, the Belfast Telegraph reports \"GPs defend Â£10 fee for signing Irish passport\". The paper reports that a Belfast City Post Office employee said there had been a hike in complaints about the \"surprise fees\" charged for signing a patient's application form. However, the British Medical Association tells the paper GPs are under \"tremendous pressure\". \"Signing a passport is not an essential service and that is why regrettably we have had to introduce a fee,\" it added. You may have heard about the parish in County Galway which held a drive-thru service for those unable to attend the Ash Wednesday Mass at St Patrick's Church in Glenamaddy. All the papers report on this story - The Irish News says \"hundreds\" of busy parishioners got their ashes to go, while the Daily Mirror, unable to resist a pun (who can?) heads its story with \"Flash Wednesday\". If you thought being a bus driver was a cushy number, think again. In The Belfast Telegraph we hear from two veteran bus drivers from Londonderry with 80 years behind the wheel between them. Johnny McLaughlin and Noel Christy describe how hi-jacking was commonplace during the Troubles but told the paper they weren't nearly as bad as \"being attacked\" by drunk people. Mr Christy describes having a gun held to his head as a \"terrifying experience\". But, despite his dramatic career he says bus driving is a \"great job\" and little kindnesses, such as an unexpected bar of chocolate or word of praise from passengers make his job worth while. Claustrophobics can look away now. The News Letter has an unusual sight on its front page. An (alive) man lying in coffin. The man in question, is John Edwards, who is beginning a three-day stint in a speciality built underground coffin, in Willowfield church in Belfast, to \"reach out to those with mental health issues\". The Irish News and Belfast Telegraph also report on his mission. He told the papers his Christian faith has helped him over come addiction. \"I know this is a radical move but people are contacting me who are suicidal or know friends and family who are. My plan is to speak to them from the grave before they get there and show them hope,\" he said. It is worth noting that Mr Edwards looks in remarkably good spirits for a man about to spend the next three days underground."}
{"text": "UK Sport has decided to put money into other sports ahead of the Rio Games in 2016 and Tokyo 2020. Three Paralympic sports - wheelchair fencing, goalball and five-a-side football - have suffered the same fate. UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholls said it would be \"high risk\" to continue funding sports with little chance of winning a medal by 2020. Around £350m will be spent preparing Britain's best medal chances at both the Olympics and Paralympics. The sports that have missed out have until March to lodge an appeal. British Basketball reacted to the news with \"disappointment\" and claimed the UK Sport funding system \"appears to show bias against team and emerging sport\". The sport was in a similar position a year ago, but managed to win funding for a further year on appeal. Now that money has gone completely. \"The basketball community at home and abroad will be aghast that this can happen again,\" said Roger Moreland, British Basketball's performance chairman. \"We are still on the road to Rio but we now have to qualify for EuroBasket 2015 with our hands tied behind our back.\" Drew Sullivan, captain of British men's team, hit out at the news on Twitter, accusing the decision-makers of \"not having a clue\". He told BBC Radio 5 live: \"I'm desperately disappointed, not only as a player or fan of basketball but also as a parent. \"I have three kids and two of them are hugely interested in basketball and when they see me pull on a GB uniform, they say: 'Dad, I want to play for my country as well.' \"What hope do they have to achieve their dreams if it doesn't seem to be seen as very important to UK Sport?\" British Swimming was equally upset with the decision to cut funding to synchronised swimming and water polo. Chief executive David Sparkes called it \"an extremely dark day for women's sport in this country\" and said the announcement \"could well signal the death of these historic Olympic sports in Britain\". He added: \"We will now carefully look at our options and may well consider a more formal appeal over these devastating decisions.\" British Weightlifting chief executive Ashley Metcalfe said: \"Although initially disappointing, it cannot have been an easy decision for UK Sport\", adding he was \"delighted\" their Paralympic powerlifting funding remained unchanged. Funding has also been reduced for two of the 19 Olympic sports that receive UK Sport funds. Swimming has seen its pot go down to £20.8m from £21.4m (3% cut), while badminton's funding is down to £5.7m from £5.9m (4% cut). UK Sport said funds had been increased to 18 Olympic and Paralympic sports following the \"most rigorous annual investment review process\". Several sports have had a funding increase, including triathlon, whose pot of money goes up from £5.5m to £7.5m, a 35% increase. Others with increased funding include canoeing, fencing, gymnastics, hockey, judo, sailing, shooting and taekwondo. In Paralympic sport, para-canoe received the biggest rise, up 33% from £2.3m to just over £3m, while disability sailing had a 29% increase, from £2.8m to £3.6m. Three Olympic sports that had their funding cut a year ago - handball, table tennis and wrestling - did not receive funding."}
{"text": "In the capital Brasilia, riot police fired pepper spray at protesters outside the presidential palace. Lula is currently being investigated in a major corruption scandal. Hours after the move, the federal judge leading the probe against Lula released phone recordings suggesting Ms Rousseff appointed Lula to spare him arrest. Brazil's leader, who is herself facing impeachment proceedings, defended the appointment. She said Lula was a \"skilful political negotiator\" and experienced leader who would help kick off economic recovery. She said the ex-president could also still be prosecuted by the Supreme Court. The release of the telephone recordings caused an uproar in Congress in Brasilia, with chaotic scenes as opposition leaders gathered around a microphone chanting \"resign, resign\". There were also demonstrations in at least three other Brazilian cities. \"Theft, corruption, that's the coup... We're not clowns. Brazil is better than all of this,\" Reuters news agency quoted one Brasilia protester as saying. Lula was briefly detained and questioned earlier this month over allegations of money laundering connected to Operation Car Wash, a massive investigation into corruption at the state oil giant, Petrobras. He denies the allegations, saying they are aimed at preventing him from running for president again in 2018. In the taped telephone conversation released by Judge Sergio Moro, who is overseeing the Petrobas probe, Ms Rousseff offered to send Lula a copy of his appointment \"in case of necessity\" - interpreted by some as meaning in case he needed it to avoid arrest. Part of the phone call released by Judge Moro Rousseff: \"Hello? Lula: \"Hello.\" Rousseff: \"Lula let me tell you something.\" Lula: \"Tell me, dear.\" Rousseff: \"The following: I am sending you Bessias [one of her judicial advisers] with a paper for us to have it and only use it if necessary, it is the investiture documents, OK?\" Lula: \"Uhuh. OK, OK.\" Rousseff: \"That's it, wait there and he is going there.\" Lula: \"OK, I am here, I'll be waiting.\" Rousseff: \"OK?\" Lula: \"OK.\" Rousseff: \"Bye.\" Lula: \"Bye, dear.\" Ms Rousseff has said she will refer Judge Moro to the Supreme Court for political interference. Lula and other ministers appointed by Ms Rouseff are expected to be sworn in at 10:00 (13:00 GMT) on Thursday. Under Brazilian law, cabinet members can only be tried by the Supreme Court. As chief of staff, Lula is expected to lead the fight against moves in Congress to impeach President Rousseff over allegations she manipulated Brazil's account books to hide a growing deficit. The impeachment push is not directly related to the corruption scandal, but has run in tandem with it. Analysts say President Rousseff is hoping that Lula will use his political nous and influence with members of Congress to block the proceedings. The two politicians have been close for decades - Lula was Ms Rousseff's political mentor and she is his hand-picked successor. During his time in office, the Brazilian economy experienced unprecedented economic growth and wealth redistribution. Profile: Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva"}
{"text": "However, even though each attack was met with domestic outrage, in the end India's leadership, regardless of political ideology, eschewed any military response. At best, according to knowledgeable journalists, they permitted some cross border artillery barrages. The standard justification for inaction was the apparent risk of escalation, culminating in a nuclear exchange. In effect, Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons and its stated first-use doctrine had effectively neutralised any public retaliatory action by India. The view from Pakistan Some political commentators in India sought to put a suitable gloss on this policy of inaction by referring to it as \"strategic restraint\". This week however, the Narendra Modi government departed from past precedent. Shortly after the attack on the Indian military base at Uri on 18 September, which had resulted in the deaths of 19 soldiers, an army spokesman had said that the country would respond \"at a time and place of our own choosing\". At a political level, Prime Minister Modi stated that the attack \"would not go unpunished\". After some deliberation, on the night of 29 September, Indian special forces apparently struck across the Line of Control. The army said the strikes were directed against terrorist launch pads and appeared to have inflicted some casualties. It is worth noting that India's Director-General of Military Operations, Lieutenant-General Ranbir Singh, had called up his Pakistani counterpart to alert him of the strikes. This was an extremely prudent and deft gesture as it clearly conveyed to the Pakistani military that India was carrying out a very limited set of incursions. This operation has contradicted the popular belief that Pakistan's stated \"red lines\" meant that India could not engage in punitive strikes because of the inherent risks of nuclear escalation. This belief persisted even though India managed to very successfully carry out the entire Kargil operation in 1999 under this nuclear shadow. Once again, it needs to be recalled that the Kargil conflict was conducted with suitable Indian restraint. For example, Indian air force pilots had been under strict instructions not to breach the Line of Control for fear of provoking Pakistani concerns about a wider war. It is entirely possible that in the days and weeks ahead, Pakistan will feel compelled to retaliate against this publicly acknowledged Indian action. Many people have left their homes in villages close to the border with Pakistan in India's Punjab, fearing an escalation of hostilities. It should also be noted that in a phone conversation with the US National Security Adviser, Susan Rice, India's National Security Adviser, Ajit Doval, made it clear that no further actions were contemplated. This meant that there was little to no possibility of an escalatory spiral. In turn, her office issued a clear statement calling on Pakistan to rein in two UN-designated terrorist organisations based in the country, the Jaish-e-Mohammed and the Lashkar-e-Taiba. Even as further details about this military operation are awaited it is evident that India has now crossed a threshold in dealing with what it says are Pakistan's persistent provocations. It has also shown that despite the ongoing turmoil in the Kashmir Valley, the regime in Delhi is still willing to carry out a strike into Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. Some commentators within India have suggested that this incident will only fuel further jingoistic sentiment in the country and could thereby easily plunge it into an inadvertent conflict. Such an argument, while superficially attractive, is actually quite flawed. The action that was taken was limited in scope, firepower and duration. Its purpose was strictly punitive and demonstrative. Having orchestrated this operation with some finesse and with little fanfare the government should now seize the opportunity in the restive Kashmir valley. Instead of seeing the disturbances in the state as a purely law and order problem it needs to tackle the persistent political grievances that have wracked the state for some time. Such a strategy will undercut attempts to stoke discontent in the Valley and blunt any efforts to revive the last embers of the insurgency in the state.

{"text": "Ronald MacNeil, 55, from Leven, admitted failing to ensure there was a standby frogman poised to help when Graeme Mackie  entered the water. Mr Mackie, 31, resurfaced in distress and shouting for help just a minute into his first dive in the Forth. The incident happened on 11 June 2011. Sentence was deferred until 29 July. After getting into difficulties, the father-of-one, from Tranent, East Lothian, sank unconscious to the river bed. Dunfermline Sheriff Court heard that MacNeil jumped in to the sea, 600 metres off Methil Harbour in a bid to rescue Mr Mackie. He was eventually recovered and airlifted to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where he was pronounced dead. MacNeil had been due to face trial accused of being responsible for a series of health and safety failings that led to the tragedy. However, Louise Beattie, prosecuting, accepted a plea to a single failing, not having a standby diver who could have gone to Mr Mackie's aid in an emergency, in consequence of which Mr Mackie drowned. She said it was \"a serious breach\". The court was told the \"Rob Roy\" had been involved in electro-fishing, a practice where a generator on the ship sends charges to electrodes trailed on the seabed, shocking shellfish to rise to the surface of the sandy bottom, where they can be collected. However, the depute fiscal said there was no evidence this was a factor in Mr Mackie's death, which was caused by drowning. The court heard Mr Mackie had previously been employed as a welder and had undertaken \"an intensive underwater dive course\". Ms Beattie, a specialist health and safety prosecutor, said Mr Mackie's ambition was to eventually become an underwater welder, and that he had advertised himself as a trainee shellfish diver online, prompting MacNeil, a fisherman with many years' experience, to get in touch. The depute fiscal said both Mr Mackie's father and brother were not aware that he had any previous commercial diving experience. Ms Beattie said MacNeil had checked Mr Mackie's diving equipment and was satisfied everything was fine before allowing him into the water. In order to know when to start the electrodes for electro-fishing, it was decided that Mr Mackie would remove his mouth piece and the surfacing of the bubbles would indicate he was ready to start fishing. The court heard that after entering the water, Mr Mackie re-surfaced about \"10 to 15 seconds later in distress\". Miss Beattie added that a dive computer had calculated that from the time Mr Mackie had entered the water to the time he was discovered, was 24 minutes. MacNeil could be jailed for a maximum of two years under health and safety and diving and work regulations. He is the second boatman in four months to be convicted over safety failings surrounding the death of a diver while electro-fishing for shellfish in the Firth of Forth. In March, Guthrie Melville, 60, owner of the 26-foot \"Solstice\", was jailed for nine months of contravening health and safety regulations which led to the death of James Irvine, 42.

{"text": "Mr Khan accused the US of sabotaging peace efforts with the Pakistani Taliban by killing its leader Hakimullah Mehsud last Friday. \"I mean are they a friend or an enemy?\" the former cricketer asked the BBC. He says he will organise protests on routes to and from Afghanistan if drone attacks do not end by 20 November. Nato convoys through Pakistan carry more than half the food, fuel and other equipment needed by Western troops fighting the Taliban in Afghanistan. Manoeuvrings to pick new Taliban head The BBC's Richard Galpin in Islamabad says the Americans are very unlikely to stop their drone strikes because they believe they are weakening the militant groups. Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is opposed to the drones but does not want to damage relations with the US by blocking Nato's supply routes, our correspondent adds. Hakimullah Mehsud was killed at a compound in the tribal region of North Waziristan near the Afghan border, just as the government in Islamabad hoped to get peace talks with the Taliban and other militants under way. Mr Khan said there was no coincidence in the timing of Fridays' attack. \"Absolutely deliberate - this was a deliberate targeting of the peace process,\" he said in a BBC interview. \"The US clearly knew what was going on and everyone in Pakistan knew what was going on. \"We'd been waiting for two months for this peace process to start and then finally when everyone had come to a consensus for peace, they destroyed the peace process. \"The people of Pakistan want peace so we will do whatever is in our hands - which is to block the supply to put pressure on the US  to stop this madness, because all it's doing is fanning fanaticism.\" Although a government delegation was set to visit North Waziristan to discuss possible peace talks, correspondents say that dialogue about peace was embryonic and the Taliban was known to be divided over the matter. Previous \"peace\" deals have all failed. Mr Khan has led anti-drone protests in the past and his PTI party are in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in the north-west. But correspondents say any decision to close routes into and out of Afghanistan would have to come from the government in Islamabad. In November 2011 a row with the US led to Pakistan barring Nato convoys from entering or leaving Afghanistan for seven months. The routes are vital as Nato prepares to withdraw all combat forces by the end of 2014, although it has other more expensive options via Central Asia. Five days on from his death, the Taliban are still discussing Hakimullah Mehsud's successor. Among the candidates named by local media as a potential replacement is Khan Said Sajna, a regional commander said to be open to the idea of peace talks. But other candidates such as the hard-line Mullah Fazlullah, whose men shot and almost killed the schoolgirl and campaigner Malala Yousafzai and who is currently based in northern Afghanistan, were also said to be in the frame. BBC correspondents say the Pakistan Taliban are a loose and at times fractious group, and reaching an agreement on a new leader will test the ability of the senior commanders to work together. For the moment the Taliban have said there will be no further peace talks as they say they have been \"deceived\" by the Pakistani government. Pakistan summoned the US ambassador over the weekend to protest over the drone strike. But the US state department said talks with the Taliban were \"an internal matter\" for Pakistan and referred to Mehsud's alleged role in attacks on US citizens. The US had a bounty of $5m on Mehsud's head. The state department described him as the head of the group which planned the failed bombing of Times Square in 2010, and said the Pakistani Taliban had a \"symbiotic\" relationship with al-Qaeda. In a rare interview with the BBC weeks before his killing, Mehsud laid down his conditions for peace - including the introduction of a harsh and controversial version of Islamic law in Pakistan. The strike came just a week after Prime Minister Sharif met US President Barack Obama for wide-ranging talks in which they pledged to strengthen ties between the nations, recently strained by the issue of drone strikes. As well as Mehsud, a number of top militants have been killed by drones in recent years. The previous Pakistan Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike in 2009."}

{"text": "Why does the Scottish National Party and its former leader matter? Because, if the general election polls are right, in six weeks time the SNP could hold the balance of power in the House of Commons. If neither Labour nor the Conservatives win a majority, one of them would need votes from smaller parties to govern - and the pollsters suggest the SNP could be the biggest of those smaller parties, perhaps with about 50 MPs. This week Mr Salmond, who hopes to be among that number, launched a thousand newspaper columns written by observers apparently astonished and horrified at his statements of the obvious. Shock! SNP MPs would not vote for a Tory Queen's Speech, said Mr Salmond. Did anyone think they would? Horror! They would try to influence a Labour chancellor's budget. Did anyone think they wouldn't? Mr Salmond's appearance on the Andrew Marr show was described by Conservative defence minister Anna Soubry as \"one of the scariest\" she had heard for a very long time. \"The audacity is astonishing,\" she told the man himself as they cosied up on the studio sofa, adding waspishly: \"There was a wonderful debate in Scotland. You lost it.\" Ms Soubry was echoing sentiments which have abounded for weeks now. Reheating the most incendiary phrase in British politics Allan Massie in the Mail on Sunday foresaw the River Thames foaming with blood. \"The English bulldog has woken from a long sleep, and is beginning to snarl,\" he warned. For Max Hastings, in the Daily Mail: \"A historic tragedy beckons for the UK... the backlash in the south will prove bitter indeed.\" So who benefits from all this? As it happens, the rhetoric might suit both the SNP and the Tories, at least in the short-term, in their battles against a mutual enemy: Labour. North of the border the SNP are trying to portray themselves as the party that stands up for Scotland and its interests against the pitiless Tories. To the south, the Tories want to present themselves as the defenders of England and its interests against the socialist hordes, kilted or otherwise. This clash of two nationalisms is disheartening for the significant chunk of Scotland which viewed last year's debate about independence as distracting and divisive rather than energising and exciting. In particular it's bad news for the Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson who took to the pages of the London Evening Standard to say so. \"The SNP is not Scotland and Scotland is not the SNP,\" she warned, describing nationalist tactics as \"cheap, dirty politics\" designed to \"stoke division\" and \"annoy the rest of the country into pushing Scotland towards the exit\". Unfortunately for her, Tory strategists in London appear to have chosen to throw fuel on to the fire, taking the opportunity to paint the Labour leader Ed Miliband as weak and the SNP as power-crazed. Mr Salmond, said a Tory party spokesman, was plotting to \"sabotage the democratic will of the British people in order to make Ed Miliband prime minister\". Robin McAlpine, director of the Common Weal think tank, part of the wider independence movement but not affiliated to the SNP, says such outrage is absurd. He says: \"If England as a nation wants to be an electoral unit of their own then they have to have a campaign of independence. If England wants to be independent of Britain, then start leafleting, start marching, and have your campaign.\" The Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy is scathing about the approach of both his rivals. \"Alex Salmond loves the sound of his own voice,\" he says. \"It's only surprising the Tories are giving him a megaphone to amplify that voice.\" \"The fact is that the Tories can't win in Scotland so they need someone else to defeat the Labour Party for them.\" Mr Murphy insists voters north of the border will see through this attempt to \"divide and rule\". For her part, the leader of the SNP, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, denies that she has sent Mr Salmond southwards to stir up dissent. Nor, she says, is he doing so off his own bat. \"That is not the objective of the SNP in this election,\" she insists. \"We're not there to prod anybody or get a rise out of anybody. \"We're there to seek to stand up for Scotland to get better policies coming out of the House of Commons.\" To satisfy its burgeoning membership - now said to be above 100,000 - the SNP will need those policies to be radical, says Mr McAlpine. Otherwise \"they're going to shed those members,\" he says. This move to the left has \"already started,\" Mr McAlpine argues, with an economic document from the Scottish government giving \"greater economic equality the same weight as economic growth\". It is \"a big step,\" he says. Mr McAlpine also defends Mr Salmond against the charge of provoking the English. \"I don't think he's driving a wedge between Scotland and England,\" he says. \"He's driving a wedge between the politics Scotland believes in, a progressive social-democratic politics, and a politics that he doesn't believe in, the vicious anti-immigrant, anti-welfare politics which seems to be quite strong in the south of England.\" Whether that is the case, and whatever the motivations of both the SNP and the Conservatives, there are big risks ahead. If the Tories get it wrong they could put the union they support in peril. The SNP faces the opposite problem. In particular, three potential scenarios could be tricky for the party: None of these options looks particularly attractive for the nationalists, especially when you consider that the SNP is still tainted in the eyes of some Scots for voting 36 years ago today against the Labour Prime Minister Jim Callaghan in a confidence motion. Mr Callaghan lost by one vote and the era of Margaret Thatcher followed, to the horror of many people in Scotland. Now, Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon clearly think they could cause a lot of mischief before a crunch point like this was reached, amending bills here and there and squeezing out concessions. In the meantime Ms Sturgeon's message can be summed up as: you wanted us to stay in the union, so now we want to have a say in it. The trouble is everybody knows that staying in the union is not the SNP's principal aim. Why would stable and secure governance of the United Kingdom be a priority for a party which doesn't believe the UK should even exist? Any politician thinking of quaffing champagne at this stage cannot know whether they will end up raising a toast or weeping into their glass."}

{"text": "It is called 2014 MU69, and was one of two comet-like objects that were under consideration by scientists working on the mission. The US space agency will now carry out a review of the plan before officially approving the mission's extension. New Horizons carried out its flyby of Pluto in July, approaching to 12,500km from the dwarf planet's surface. The spacecraft captured detailed images and other data not only of Pluto, but also of its moons: Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra. The new target is about one and a half billion kilometres beyond Pluto. It is about 45km across and is thought to be one of the building blocks from which bigger worlds such as Pluto are formed. Such objects form a region of the outer Solar System called the Kuiper Belt, containing a deep-freeze sample of what our cosmic neighbourhood was like when it formed 4.6 billion years ago. \"Even as the New Horizon's spacecraft speeds away from Pluto out into the Kuiper Belt, and the data from the exciting encounter with this new world is being streamed back to Earth, we are looking outward to the next destination for this intrepid explorer,\" said John Grunsfeld, head of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate. \"We expect it to be much less expensive than the prime mission, while still providing new and exciting science.\" The spacecraft carries enough hydrazine fuel for another flyby, and scientists say it could continue operating into the late 2020s or beyond. The mission's principal investigator, Alan Stern, called Nasa's selection of 2014 MU69 \"a great choice\". He added: \"This KBO costs less fuel to reach [than other candidate targets], leaving more fuel for the flyby, for ancillary science, and greater fuel reserves to protect against the unforeseen.\" In summer 2014, the Hubble Space Telescope was used to discover five icy objects, later narrowed to two, within New Horizons' flight path. In late October and early November, the spacecraft will perform a series of engine burns to set its course toward 2014 MU69 ahead of an encounter currently set for 1 January 2019."}

{"text": "At the Pentagon recently, US President Barack Obama announced deep cuts to the US military and set out a shift in attention towards the Asia-Pacific region, in a thinly-veiled message to China. Despite a narrative of peaceful intent, China's leaders have struggled to reassure the US over the direction of the People's Liberation Army (PLA).  Both countries admit that their military dialogue falls well behind other aspects of the relationship. So the shift has brought renewed scrutiny of the PLA's latest capabilities against US dominance in the Pacific. In recent years the PLA has demonstrated impressive new capabilities at sea and in space, aimed at showcasing the success of its modernisation effort. The obvious message is to deliver a powerful warning if Taiwan were to declare formal independence. But Pentagon planners are now concerned that the Taiwan contingency has been eclipsed by China's broader maritime territorial claims and demands for more international space to protect the arteries feeding China's growth. China is developing a range of capabilities linked to the space and cyber domain in order to sidestep the overwhelming might of the US military in the Pacific region. The PLA calls this fighting \"local wars under informationised conditions\". China recognised almost two decades ago that in the mid-term the PLA could be no match for US conventional forces. So it began working on what was dubbed \"unrestricted warfare\" - combining multiple methods to defeat a superior opponent. At the same time party leaders launched adventurous civilian acquisition projects in the high-tech domain to increase Chinese competitiveness and to boost indigenous production capabilities. The PLA has been running military projects mirroring these civilian acquisition ventures. Sometimes involving dual-use technologies, the military and civilian strands have often been indistinguishable. China's space programme is a case in point. The recent successful docking manoeuvre between a Shenzhou module and the Tiangong Space station is as much a triumph for the PLA as it is for China's civilian space agency. Should the US ever intervene in a cross-strait clash or challenge China's maritime claims, Beijing would employ a pre-emptive \"sea denial\" strategy alongside its conventional operations - preventing US battle carrier groups operating in or near its claimed territorial waters. Its submarine-launched ballistic and cruise missiles are now a lethal force. China's long-range nuclear weapons systems have also undergone significant upgrades and its strategic rocket force, the Second Artillery Corps, is very much the pride of the PLA. One of the most pressing concerns for the US navy is the threat posed by a \"carrier killer\" anti-ship missile with enhanced targeting capabilities facilitated from space. China very recently launched its own Beidou Positioning System, challenging the monopoly of the US Global Positioning System (GPS). One of the PLA's most sensitive advances has been the secret deployment and testing of advanced anti-satellite (ASAT) and Anti Ballistic Missile (ABM) weapons systems. Two years ago, China successfully intercepted  one of its own ballistic missiles as it streaked through space. This test coincided with the Pentagon's sale of Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) Patriot systems to Taiwan. Some experts believe a Chinese ASAT campaign against a careful selected group of US satellites could have catastrophic effect on the US military. This capability, combined with the potential for China to develop its own Ballistic Missile Defence umbrella, suggests that the space domain will be a new theatre for US-China rivalry. Chinese ASAT capabilities are not exclusively reserved for \"kill vehicles\", like the one which obliterated an ageing Chinese weather satellite in 2007. It is now believed that the successful 2007 \"kill\" was in fact the third test in a series. Previous tests had demonstrated an ability to manoeuvre in proximity to targeted satellites. This would suggest that China has experimented with techniques which could be used for \"space mining\", where mines or mini-satellites armed with jamming technologies could be placed within the orbits of an opponent's spacecraft. In addition to its \"sea denial\" and space warfare strategies, China is also expanding its conventional capabilities. The PLA Air Force in recent years has extended its ability for offshore operations, enhancing an offensive capability. It is planning an overhaul of its ageing fleet with the deployment of over 3,000 new aircraft. For the most part China has relied on copying Russian fighter technology. However, the roll-out of the Chengdu J-20 Stealth fighter prototype raised eyebrows last year, carefully timed to coincide with a visit by the US defence secretary. There have been some very significant developments in the deployment of Chinese submarines in recent years. Beijing possesses 10 Russian-built ultra-quiet Kilo class submarines possibly armed with 200km-range anti-ship cruise missiles. Since 2006, when a Chinese submarine surfaced undetected within torpedo range of the US aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk, China's submarine force has regularly marauded the US Navy and its allies in the Pacific. It is thought that China plans to build three aircraft carrier battle groups, each armed with 40 fighters, up to eight warships, three nuclear-powered attack submarines and a number of support vessels. The PLA Navy's retrofitted Varyag carrier, currently under sea-trials, will serve as a training platform. Even if the aircraft carrier would likely be a prestige piece and more directed at Chinese domestic pride, the prospect of a Chinese aircraft carrier will certainly cause ripples for the broader East Asian naval balance. While much attention has been paid to the breakneck speed of Chinese military modernisation over the last decade, the events of 9/11 and the subsequent campaigns in the Middle East and Afghanistan provided a window of opportunity for China to accelerate development. In some cases there may have been, quite literally, windfalls for the PLA. There is speculation that China acquired undamaged Tomahawk cruise missile components in the early stages of the Afghanistan campaign a decade ago. When US special forces failed to completely destroy one of their stealth helicopters during Operation Geronimo, Pakistan's military may have allowed PLA counterparts to inspect the tail rotor. The PLA must be congratulating itself on the impressive array of weaponry which has tilted the balance in the Taiwan Strait in its favour. China's new-found capabilities combined with the opaque nature of its military modernisation create a formula for mistrust with the US. There are perhaps three factors for uncertainty. Firstly, the Chinese military's confidence in its new equipment could lead to an overestimation of its capability as an emerging great power. Secondly, the Chinese leadership could underestimate its ability to control an unexpected escalation of hostilities in the Pacific. Finally, the domestic political factor - the PLA's external behaviour could become a reaction to internal nationalistic sentiment, instability or faction fighting as Beijing prepares for the fifth generation leadership handover this year."}

The doctor, known as a medical incident officer, cared for eight patients at the hospital, on 10 April.

{"text": "Stand by for a prolonged debate and argument over the detail of the proposed sugar tax on soft drinks - which might possibly end up in the courts. Mr Osborne made it as clear as he could in front of the Commons Treasury Select Committee that he would press on with the measure whatever the objections from manufacturers: \"It's not a threat or a promise, it's the way it's going to be. And I think it's the right thing for this country,\" he said. There have been reports of soft drink producers considering a possible European Court challenge. But industry sources indicate this is premature and that they are waiting to see the full detail of the levy, which is set to be imposed in April 2018. The Food and Drink Federation noted that the Chancellor told MPs he received clear legal advice that a sugar tax would be lawful. The organisation has now written to the Treasury asking for this advice to be published. We don't yet know at what level the tax will be set. The Treasury has said there will be two bands, 5g and 8g of added sugar per 100 millilitres. The Office for Budget Responsibility says it's assuming the levy will be 18p and 24p per litre respectively to meet the government's revenue targets, but there has been no confirmation of this. Milk-based drinks with added sugar and pure fruit juices will not be subject to the levy. But these exemptions have been questioned in some quarters. Producers of cranberry juice, which can include added sugar, have already begun a campaign to be taken out of the reach of the levy, arguing for the health benefits of their product. Researchers at Liverpool University and Queen Mary, London, have said they feel the amount of sugar in some fruit juices is \"unacceptably high\". The Institute for Fiscal Studies has published its own detailed analysis. It says that people might simply switch from drinks which are subject to the levy to those which are not and other sweetened products.  The IFS also points out that small drinks producers are exempt and this could mean that these operators might promote high-sugar products which are tax-free more vigorously. The IFS notes, too, that soft drinks are subject to VAT while cakes and other sugary foods are zero-rated, which means in effect that they are being subsidised by the tax authorities. The IFS, which does not pull its punches if it feels the need to criticise a tax policy, makes clear that a levy on sugary drinks is not necessarily a bad idea. But it does argue that the Chancellor needs to rethink the banding system. Under the current plan, a drink with 8g of sugar per 100ml will be taxed at the same rate as one with double the amount of sugar or more. The Chancellor, argues the IFS, should ensure the tax better targets the sugar content of drinks. The British Soft Drinks Association says it is \"absurd\" to pick on soft drinks when this is the only category in the food and drink industry sector which has consistently cut sugar content in the last few years.  It will continue to lobby hard against the introduction of the levy and argue for a voluntary sugar reduction plan. So the question now is how many more interested parties and critics will respond to George Osborne's call to \"bring it on\". The consultation process, once the documentation is released, is sure to be a lively one."}
{"text": "About 500 natterjack toadlets have been counted at the RSPB's The Lodge reserve near Sandy, Bedfordshire, - fives times more toads than were counted in 2016. Another 2,000 tadpoles have also been identified and were an indication of a \"baby boom\", the charity said. The protected toads are only found at 60 sites in the UK. In 2016 just 100 toadlets emerged from the pools at the reserve, and fewer than 100 were counted the year before, warden Lizzie Bruce said. More news from Norfolk Natterjacks live in coastal sand dunes, coastal grazing marshes and sandy heaths. About 70% of the toads' colonies were lost in the last century through habitat destruction, the RSPB said. Conservationists were not optimistic for this breeding season as a cold April and dry May meant some ponds dried out completely. However, a recent count of toadlets and tadpoles was \"evidence the natterjacks were able to move quickly to spawn\", they said. The numbers were \"unprecedented\" in her three years at the reserve, Ms Bruce said. When babies emerge they are just the size of a thumbnail but \"the ground around the pools was literally moving there were so many toadlets\", she said. Despite the poor conditions, the charity believes the five-fold increase in toad numbers might because aquatic predators like dragonfly larvae that would normally eat the natterjack tadpoles were unable to survive when the pools dried up. When they refilled and the natterjack returned to spawn, there were no predators left. Natterjacks were introduced into the Lodge reserve in 1980s from a Wildlife Trust reserve in west Norfolk."}
{"text": "The practice has become so common that many women don't even consider it harassment - many consider it a mere annoyance, a necessary evil in the modern cyber quest for love. Whitney Wolfe, a co-founder of dating app Tinder, says she wants her new company to disrupt the sector, and cut back on the amount of online harassment directed towards women. She describes her start-up Bumble as a \"feminist dating app\", where men are typically more polite, because women make the first move. \"In every other facet of a young woman's life we are owning our worlds in a very independent way,\" Ms Wolfe says from her hip, co-working space in Austin, Texas. \"We work, we create, we support ourselves, and it's encouraged to do so. The only thing that hasn't caught up to that is how we date.\" The 26-year-old entrepreneur founded Bumble a year ago. She says the restrictions in the app which block men from driving the conversations are pushing social change. The word feminism has been co-opted and contorted, she says, but \"what it really means is equality between men and women\". When women make the first move, she says, men are often flattered and behave much more politely. In the world of dating apps, Ms Wolfe is famous for co-founding and then being ousted from Tinder, the wildly popular dating tool that first started in 2012. She then sued her fellow co-founders last year for sexual harassment. Ms Wolfe refused to discuss details of the case with the BBC, but she maintained her \"co-founder\" status, and she reportedly received about $1m (Â£650,000) when the lawsuit was settled with no admission of wrong doing. Maintaining the \"founder\" title is important. Female founders and chief executives are rare. Fewer than 3% of venture capital-backed companies are run by women, according to a 2014 study by Babson College about bridging the gender gap in entrepreneurship. \"Only a small portion of early-stage investment is going to women entrepreneurs, yet our data suggest that venture capital-funded businesses with women on the executive team perform better on multiple dimensions,\" the report's author Candida Brush said when it was released. \"The venture capital community, therefore, may be missing good investment opportunities by not investing in women entrepreneurs.\" Ms Wolfe says it's important for women to feel empowered in dating as well as in business, where women too often \"hesitate\" to start their own companies. \"Sometimes there's this hesitation involved with women\" when it comes to starting businesses, she says. \"There's this hold back there, and until we break the mould - and there are positive examples set, and it's something that is achievable - I don't think we're going to see much of a change.\" Ms Wolfe isn't the only entrepreneur breaking the mould when it comes to dating apps where women call the shots. Siren is a dating platform made by women and marketed to women users. It allows women to control their visibility, so they can block their profile from other users. For example, some users only make their profile visible to social media contacts. How pervasive is harassment online? A Pew Research Centre report in 2013 found that 28% of online daters have been harassed or made to feel uncomfortable. For women, 42% have experienced negative contact, compared with just 17% of men. One online dating user, Mandy Tugwell, says she removed her online dating profile from a mainstream dating site after she got naked pictures of men, and was repeatedly asked if she was into sexual fetishes. \"I was like, OK this isn't going to work,\" she says. \"I got really creeped out.\" But Ms Tugwell did find a serious relationship on a niche dating site targeted at black women and Asian men. Ms Wolfe says the crowded field of online dating and social media networking sites isn't intimidating. Tinder is a juggernaut, and there are dozens of other niche sites to choose from, she says. Finding love and connections is \"a huge, huge need\" she adds. \"It's part of who we are as human, to date and find people to share time with. \"I don't think we need to compete with anyone. I think we can be a standalone entity that is trying to fill a void. \"It's a unique mission.  I'm happy to compete in a field that's crowded.\""}
{"text": "But along with the traditional wind farms and solar panels, scientists have also been adding some fun and creativity into the mix with these unusual designs. This is the world's first ever full-scale floating wind farm, which is being built in the north-east of Scotland. It's called Hywind, and is a trial project that's been set up in Peterhead. The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines. It's hoped they'll produce power for around 20,000 homes. This is a solar farm like you've probably never seen one before. Solar panels are normally arranged in a grid of rows and lines, but these designers decided to be a bit more creative. This solar farm in Datong, China, is based on China's national animal - the Giant Panda. The power plant is as big as two football pitches, and the company behind it say when it's fully completed, it will have enough energy to power around 16,400 homes. Back in 2015, Dutch renewable energy company Qurrent surprised people with their plans to turn a wind farm into the \"world's first sustainable theme park\". The idea was not only to power the rides using wind, but also to turn wind turbines themselves into amusement park rides! They also wanted to create a spiralling water slide winding around a wind turbine tower, and a ride that would be based around a turbine blade booster. But don't expect to see a theme park like this just yet. The designs were just part of a study to see if something like this could work, and the company say they currently have no plans to build it. We're 'big fans' of the idea. This man-made forest is found in Singapore's Bay South garden. The 18 \"super-trees\" each have solar panels and convert the energy into electricity for lighting and to power air vents. They also act as vertical gardens. The plants growing on them help keep the city cool by providing shade. And their special shape allows them to collect rainwater, releasing clean water back into the environment. This special design for wave power technology is the creation of a company in Australia called Carnegie Wave Energy. But it's different from other tidal power devices because it works underwater where it is safer from large storms and invisible from the shore. So how does it work? Well it converts wave energy into electricity in the same way as most other tidal plants would. But the main difference is that it's completely under water so has very little impact on beachgoers and on the environment."}
{"text": "You only ever hear about statutory rights not being affected - you never see a sign saying that something does affect your statutory rights. You generally see the expression in shops or on manufactured goods referring to the returns policy, which is governed by the Sale of Goods Act. \"It's all about getting what you bargained for,\" says Ron Turner, a lawyer at Buss Murton. \"The main things are that they should last as long as you would expect, and that they are fit for purpose.\" So can anything affect those statutory rights? \"Generally not,\" Ron Turner says. Then why bother telling everybody that their statutory rights are not being affected? \"It is a very odd expression, it's a fairly stupid thing to say,\" says Clive Zietman, a lawyer at Stewarts Law. \"It's the loose language that companies use without thinking about the law.\" \"What they're trying to say is they might do something above what the law demands.\" Ron Turner gives the example that if you buy a packet of sausages that taste funny, you return the pack to the manufacturer and they give you your money back and pay for your postage and even give you some vouchers to buy more products, it does not affect your right to sue them if you later get food poisoning from the sausages you ate. Similarly, just because a manufacturer encourages you to return faulty goods to them for a full refund, it does not detract from your right to return them to the retailer, which would normally be your first port of call. This is the view taken by United Biscuits, which includes assurances about statutory rights being unaffected on products such as its Jacob's Cream Crackers. \"The reason this happens is that people may be concerned that by returning product they might lose the right to pursue other remedies, the public not necessarily being familiar with consumer legislation,\" the company's legal team told BBC News. \"Therefore, this is put on pack to make consumers feel more comfortable in coming direct to us on a 'without prejudice' basis.\" Julia Durham from Citizens Advice says that under the             Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading  regulations, if retailers or manufacturers are offering guarantees, they must say that what they are offering is in addition to people's legal rights. \"A lot of retailers offer store policies, trying to be helpful, but they sometimes forget that statutory rights exist as well,\" she says. She gives the example of a second-hand car dealer, which offers a free three-month warranty but says it will not help at all after that time. Under statutory rights, if the car lasts less long than could be reasonably expected, then you can try to get redress from the retailer whatever its policy is. \"Sometimes guarantees seek to take away from statutory rights,\" she warns. It is important to remember that the terms and conditions that may apply to a shop offering, for example, to refund a product if you change your mind, which it is not forced to do by law, will not apply to customers returning faulty goods, which are covered by statutory rights. So is there nothing you could do that would be so extreme that it would affect your statutory rights? Perhaps you could deliberately use forged banknotes to buy that packet of sausages and then try to sue the manufacturer when you got food poisoning. \"If you were guilty of a criminal offence, you might lose your statutory rights,\" Mr Zietman says. \"The contract would be voided by illegality, so your statutory rights would disappear.\" Mr Turner agrees that \"some judges in some courts may feel that barred you from making a claim\". Ms Durham points out that in order to have statutory rights, you have to prove that the transaction took place, perhaps with a receipt or credit card statement. What that means is that if you pay with cash and lose your receipt, that may affect your statutory rights. So it turns out that there may be some things you can do that will affect your statutory rights. It's funny that you are never warned about them!"}
{"text": "Steve McClaren had overseen a win and a draw since returning as head coach, but his side were second best against Town. The hosts dominated the second period, with Derby managing just two shots on target throughout the match. And Kachunga headed in substitute Harry Bunn's fine 93rd-minute cross to take Town to third in the Championship. Matej Vydra wasted two good first opportunities for the visitors in the first half, shooting over from a Will Hughes pass and mis-timing a header. But the Terriers upped the tempo thereafter and Nakhi Wells, Bunn, Chris Lowe and Kasey Palmer all went close before Kachunga's winner. Huddersfield boss David Wagner: \"I am angry that after two defeats I have to answer questions about the character of my players. \"At Huddersfield we are humble; we know where we come from.

We have won nine from 14 and we have under-performed once.\" Derby head coach Steve McClaren: \"It's a cruel way to end the game.

{"text": "Set 310 from a minimum of 49 overs, India slumped to 71-4 with at least 25 left, but were steadied by Virat Kohli (49 not out) and Ravichandran Ashwin. Ashwin and Wriddhiman Saha fell in the space of 16 balls, before Ravi Jadeja joined Kohli to take India to 172-6. Alastair Cook made 130 in the tourists' 260-3 declared, with Haseeb Hameed (82) missing out on a debut century. Media playback is not supported on this device The second of the five Tests begins in Visakhapatnam on Thursday. England, heavy underdogs at the start of the series, will travel east buoyed by this performance. They dictated the terms for most of the Test and, in the end, world number ones India were hanging on. In making 537, England became the first visiting team to claim a first-innings lead in India for four years, their spinners outbowled India's and Hameed may have ended the long search for an opener to partner Cook. But Visakhapatnam is likely to offer much more for the slow bowlers, which could favour India and provide England with a sterner challenge. \"England will take confidence from having competed well and they outperformed India,\" said ex-England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on BBC Test Match Special. \"But in five Tests, I'd suspect somewhere the ball will turn earlier, so winning the toss could be very important.\" England had India on the run during the final session and may have secured a remarkable victory had they held their chances before tea. After Gautam Gambhir gloved Chris Woakes to second slip in the second over, left-arm spinner Zafar Ansari dropped a very sharp return chance off Murali Vijay and, in Ansari's next over, Stuart Broad grassed a more straightforward catch low down at point off Cheteshwar Pujara. Still England pressed. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid, continuing his excellent bowling of the first innings, had Pujara lbw to a ball that pitched outside leg stump - the batsman not opting to review - and, after the break, Vijay inside-edged Rashid to short leg before Moeen Ali found huge turn to bowl Ajinkya Rahane off his pads. With the pitch starting to play tricks, Rashid and off-break bowler Moeen had the ball spinning, spitting and bouncing, all while England catchers swarmed over the home batsmen. India, not used to being under this sort of pressure in home conditions, were kept afloat by Kohli and Ashwin's stand of 47. Just as the visitors began to tire, Ashwin needlessly drove Ansari to cover and the cavalier Saha jammed a catch back to Rashid. England rushed around to squeeze in extra overs, but were denied by the pugnacious, defiant Kohli and the counter-punching of Jadeja. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew We will get the surface we are expecting in the next Test - a bit of a minefield. That was where New Zealand were bundled out for 80 in a one-day international. But I don't think England will go there nearly as fazed as they might have done. Two weeks ago they were bundled out in a session by Bangladesh, here they had India fighting for their lives. Former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott on Test Match Special England have outplayed India. The body language of India was pretty poor today, they were just waiting for England's declaration as if they knew that was when the match really started. Only Kohli and Ashwin batted well for them and saved the game. Ex-England spinner Vic Marks on TMS This is the best Test match Adil Rashid has had for England. He's bowled with more control than I've seen him playing for England, and the English spinners have caused as many problems as the Indian spinners - we weren't expecting that. Cook began his Test career with a century in India, returned in 2012 with three more and this, his fifth, moved him top of the list of overseas century-makers in this country. The left-hander resumed on 46 out of England's 114-0 and was much more fluent than the previous day, opening his shoulders in the second hour of the morning session. With trademark cuts and less-familiar lofted cover drives, Cook brought up his 30th Test ton in a stand of 68 with Ben Stokes, who was promoted to number four. When the skipper holed out off Ashwin's off-spin, he called time on England's innings. Hameed, the 19-year-old making his Test debut, was highly impressive in moving to 62 not out on the fourth evening. His performance on the final morning was less assured, with some uncertainty outside the off stump leading to an edge wide of slip off the bowling of Umesh Yadav. When England looked to push on, he unselfishly put thoughts of his century to one side and slapped a return catch back to Amit Mishra. Though he missed out on becoming the first England batsman to score a century before his 20th birthday, he did depart with the highest score made by an England teenager. England captain Alastair Cook: \"We played some good cricket. It was a good toss to win but you still have to score the runs. \"In India, if you get 530 like we did then you're always in the game. I am really proud of the lads, we were relentless with the ball and we didn't let India score quickly. To keep them to 480, I thought we played really well.\" On Haseeb Hameed's 82: \"It was a brilliant knock - he looked the real deal in the first innings, then to bat in the second innings the way he did, when we only had a lead of 50, was brilliant. I don't want to heap too much praise on him but he looks a good 'un.\" Hameed on Sky Sports: \"I did enjoy it. I felt more comfortable the more time I spent out there. I just took it as any other game in a way. It is quite surreal how quickly things have happened but I am trying to take it all in my stride and not look too far ahead.\" India captain Virat Kohli: \"We could have been much better on days one and two. We are never going to take England for granted and it is good to not give away a result at the start of the series.\""}

Following Jos Buttler's 66 from 37 balls, Chris Jordan and Ben Stokes restricted the defending champions to 11 runs from the last two overs. \"As a unit we can be quite strong and that's important confidence-wise to take into a semi-final,\" said Morgan. \"We've shown different strengths game on game. We're a reasonably good chasing side and on top of that we show a lot of character.\" England are likely to face Group 2 winners New Zealand in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Delhi, unless West Indies lose heavily to Afghanistan on Sunday. Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews hit five sixes in an unbeaten 54-ball 73 to drag his side within sight of victory but Joe Root's spectacular diving catch to dismiss Dasun Shanaka when they needed 17 from 10 balls proved crucial. \"We certainly like to make it interesting, not through choice,\" added a relieved Morgan. \"Given the position we were in after the first fix or six overs [of the Sri Lanka innings], we would have liked to have finished it off a little bit earlier. \"Going from Wednesday's performance against Afghanistan to today's performance against Sri Lanka, I think we've made a significant improvement.\" Probable last-four opponents New Zealand completed a 100% winning record by defeating Bangladesh in Kolkata on Saturday but Morgan says England will embrace the challenge. \"We won't get too far ahead of ourselves. We know anything can happen but having put ourselves in this position, it gives us a little bit of freedom to go out and express ourselves as much as we can,\" he said.

The 14 June fire destroyed 151 homes, most in the tower block, but also a number of surrounding properties. The opening of inquests into seven of the victims heard a six-month-old baby was found dead in her mother's arms. Survivors and relatives of those who died have expressed frustration at the progress of the investigation. But Det Supt Fiona McCormack said the full death toll will only be known when the search and recovery operation is over. What I can say is that we believe that around 80 people are either dead or sadly missing and I must presume that they are dead,\" the officer said. She added:  \"I don't want there to be any hidden victims. We want to understand the true human cost of this tragedy.\" Police said some residents had tried to move up the building to escape the flames and it is thought a number of people may have ended up in one flat. Det Supt McCormack said officers were having to prepare some families for the reality that their relatives' remains may never be recovered. There was \"utter devastation inside the flats,\" she said. The update on the police investigation came as Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs that cladding from 120 high-rise buildings in 37 local authority areas in England has now failed fire safety tests. Westminster coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox has opened and adjourned more inquests into the deaths of the Grenfell Tower victims. At least one person from 106 of the 129 flats at Grenfell Tower has been contacted in an attempt to identify those who might have died, police said. Some of the victims have been identified from a variety of sources including 999 calls - 26 calls received came from inside the 23 flats where the majority of people are thought to have died. The 23 flats concerned were located between the 11th and 23rd floors of Grenfell Tower. Det Supt McCormack said: \"At this stage, we must presume, that no-one in those flats survived, that includes anyone who lived there or was visiting them.\" She said a few flats were still too unsafe for police to carry out further investigation \"due to the devastation caused by the fire\". The previously given death toll was 79. Local people have created their own databases on missing people with figures which differ from those officially released. Police said they hoped information would be sent to its investigation if it might identify the missing. They said \"every imaginable source\" of information \"from government agencies to fast food companies\" had been used by officers as part of their inquiries to identify the victims. A number of Grenfell Tower residents confronted housing minister Alok Sharma MP on why the homeless are not yet rehoused, in tense exchanges on the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme."}

{"text": "The airline investigated complaints that the captain of a flight arriving in Israel announced he was \"landing in Palestine\". Iberia found the captain adhered to the standard format, naming only the airports of origin and destination. Passengers might have confused similar sounding words, the airline said. Passengers said the pilot made the announcement mentioning Palestine in Spanish, and then said in English the plane was about to land, without mentioning Palestine or Israel. During the subsequent investigation by the airline, crew members and several Spanish-speaking passengers confirmed that the announcement, given first in Spanish and subsequently in English, was \"â€¦ we're now descending to land at our destination, Tel Avivâ€¦\". The airline believes the confusion could have been caused by the similar sound of the Spanish words \"destino\", meaning \"destination\", and \"Palestina\". \"Both the company and the crew regret the misunderstanding and that some of our customers could have been offended by it,\" the airline said in a statement. The incident happened as the Iberia Airlines flight 3316 approached Tel Aviv's Ben-Gurion airport on Wednesday, Israeli media reported. One Israeli passenger, named only as Lior, told Israel's Channel 2 TV: \"We were just in shock, I don't understand why he said that. \"We live in the State of Israel and he should have said 'Israel', he didn't absentmindedly say it in English, it was intentional.\" Another passenger wrote a letter of complaint to Iberia, saying: \"My family and I were terribly offended. It was not at all acceptable and has done a disservice to your company.\" Israel became independent on part of what had been British Mandate Palestine following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in World War One. The land was known as Palestine after Roman times, and the name is still applied to the area by Palestinians and ideological opponents of the Jewish state.

It comes after the SNP virtually swept the board in the Westminster elections earlier this year, taking all but three seats north of the border. Ms Sturgeon saw off competition from Ruth Davidson and Willie Rennie to collect the award. At the ceremony at Edinburgh's Prestonfield House Hotel, she said it was a \"huge honour\". \"This has been without a shadow of a doubt the most exciting, exhilarating, challenging, privileged and downright exhausting year of my life,\" she added. Ms Sturgeon, who won the same award last year, is now the only person to have lifted the annual prize four times. Alex Salmond, her predecessor as both first minister and SNP leader, won it on three occasions. The Scottish Conservative leader Ms Davidson was awarded E-Politician of the Year, after she used Twitter to criticise Downing Street for lowering flags to half-mast following the death of Saudi King Abdullah earlier this year, describing the move as a \"steaming pile of nonsense\". She also used social media to highlight some of the homophobic abuse she receives, and jokingly suggested to Ms Sturgeon and Labour's Kezia Dugdale that they should call off First Minister's Questions at Holyrood to watch Andy Murray in a tennis match together. Scottish Liberal Deomcrat leader Mr Rennie also picked up an award, as he was named the Donald Dewar Debater of the Year, with judges praising his tenacity in highlighting the problems at Police Scotland. Fellow Liberal Democrat Alison McInnes was also honoured for her efforts to hold the force to account, as she was named Committee MSP of the Year. The Best Scot at Westminster award went to SNP Commons leader Angus Robertson, after the party went from having a group of six MPs to being the third largest party in the House of Commons following May's general election. Motor Neurone Disease (MND) patient Gordon Aikman was chosen as the Campaigner of the Year, for his Gordon's Fightback campaign, which has now raised more than ??400,000 towards finding a cure for the condition. Mr Aikman, who was diagnosed with the terminal disease at the age of 29, has also secured public funding for specialist MND nurses in Scotland, and has won a guarantee from the Scottish government to provide communications equipment to those patients who lose their voice. Accepting his award he made a plea for carers to be paid the Living Wage, saying: \"Carers are my hands, arms and legs. They are my independence, my freedom, carers allow me not just to live but to enjoy life.\" Labour's Neil Findlay was named Community MSP of the Year after the Lothians MSP raised local concerns about a flight path trial at Edinburgh Airport. Conservative Gavin Brown, who is stepping down from Holyrood in May, collected the Politics in Business Award, while Scottish Local Politician of the Year went to Cllr David Parker, the leader of Scottish Borders Council, for his efforts to ensure the Borders Railway, which links Edinburgh and Tweedbank, was completed."}

Turner has won legions of fans as the brooding, scythe-wielding Cornish hero Ross Poldark. The show has helped BBC One record its highest ratings share for the first three months of the year in a decade. Series two will be based on the third and fourth books of Winston Graham's series set in 18th century Cornwall. Eleanor Tomlinson will also reprise her role as Poldark's beloved Demelza. Poldark was originally made for TV in the 1970s, with Robin Ellis in the lead role, and hooked audiences of 15 million.

{"text": "Stefano Brizzi, from south London, admitted dismembering PC Gordon Semple, 59, while high on crystal meth. The 50-year-old claimed PC Semple died accidentally during a sex game but an Old Bailey jury found him guilty of murder. He was ordered to serve a minimum of 24 years in jail. The Italian national claimed PC Semple, who was on duty at the time, had died on 1 April during a \"sex game gone wrong\" when a dog leash he was wearing had slipped. However, the court heard it would have taken far longer for him to be strangled than Brizzi's account suggested. Brizzi denied trying to cannibalise parts of PC Semple, from Greenhithe in Kent, by cooking and then biting into a rib found in his kitchen bin. But at his sentencing, the prosecution said an expert odontologist had since confirmed that even though Brizzi claimed not to remember it, he had in fact tried to eat human flesh. Police found \"globules\" of flesh floating in the bath, bags containing bones and a part of PC Semple's head, and pools of human fat in the oven. He also told police he had \"chucked\" some of PC Semple's body into the Thames and thrown away his police badge and belongings. The judge said there were \"terrible features\" of the case and that Brizzi's drug addiction had ruined his life. He said: \"Regret you express now for Mr Semple's death has to be seen against what you did over a number of days to his body.\" The court heard Brizzi was obsessed with the American TV show Breaking Bad in which the protagonists Walter White and Jesse Pinkman dissolve a rival drug dealer in a bathtub filled with acid. When police visited Brizzi's flat on the Peabody Estate in south London, he told them how he thought he was \"getting away with it\" and was planning to finish disposing of the body later that day. In mitigation, Sallie Bennett-Jenkins QC blamed Brizzi's crystal meth addiction as she accepted the expert evidence. She said Brizzi had \"absolutely no recollection\" of it and was \"utterly horrified by it\". The court heard Brizzi had gone to Crystal Meth Anonymous meetings, but upset people by wearing a Breaking Bad T-shirt as the show \"glorified\" the drug. The pair had arranged a \"hot, dirty, sleazy session\" having met on gay dating app Grindr. In a victim impact statement read to the court, PC Semple's older brother, Ronald Semple, said his sibling had been regarded as a \"Dixon of Dock Green character\", a character from a police show which was broadcast in the 1960s and 1970s. He said his brother had worked for the force for more than 30 years and enjoyed running marathons and organising trips to France for charity. He was a \"caring and gentle person\" and \"much loved\" by his family, who were left devastated with the news of his murder, the court heard. Passing sentence the Recorder of London Nicholas Hilliard QC, said: \"The PCs on scene encountered something no amount of training could have prepared them for. I commend them both. \"Mr Semple was dearly loved by his family and friends and no sentence carried by this court can equate to the precious human life lost.\" Chief Crown Prosecutor for London Baljit Ubhey said: \"An evil and calculating man, Brizzi lied to the police and then to the court, claiming that Mr Semple's tragic death was caused when a sex game went horribly wrong.\" She also paid tribute to how her team dealt with the challenging case, particularly considering the lengths Brizzi had gone to to remove traces of his crime."}

{"text": "Some would cite its unrivalled commitment to sequins - others, the fiercely biased voting. Until recent years, though, there was little about the competition that would give politicians sleepless nights. But now a fierce row between Russia and this year's hosts - Ukraine - has seen a warning letter from Eurovision's organisers land on the Ukrainian prime minister's desk. So what's the cause of the conflict, and how did it get this far? A record 43 countries from the European Broadcasting Area were due to don their finest spandex this year. But last month, Ukraine banned Russia's chosen artist, Julia Samoilova, from entering the country for three years. Why? Because in 2015 she made what it calls an illegal visit to sing in Crimea - which was annexed by Russia three years ago - entering via Russia rather than the Ukrainian mainland. Russia and Ukraine have been at loggerheads since the annexation and subsequent fighting in east Ukraine, which Moscow is accused of stoking. Ukraine is hosting Eurovision because its singer, Jamala, won in Sweden last year. She took the crown with 1944, a song about Josef Stalin's mass deportation of Crimean Tatars during World War Two. Russia, who were favourites in the run-up to the event, limped home in third. Moscow is especially irked by the ban on Samoilova, 27, as she uses a wheelchair and the slogan of this year's Eurovision is \"Celebrate diversity\". Outrage is an understatement. A deputy foreign minister called the ban on Samoilova outrageous, cynical and inhumane. One MP is demanding that the contest be moved to another country, while a second warned that Russia would boycott every Eurovision to come unless organisers intervened to resolve the row. Russia's Channel One, which broadcasts Eurovision, said in a statement: \"Ukraine didn't even have the common sense to make use of this opportunity to look like a civilised country.\" It also refused an offer by Eurovision to have Samoilova join in the competition remotely, via satellite. \"We find the offer of remote participation odd and refuse it, for it is going absolutely against the very essence of the event,\" the official Russian broadcaster said. According to the BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Moscow, some suspect Moscow knew what would happen when it chose Julia Samoilova, knowing that she had travelled to Crimea. Eurovision organisers want the focus on the event, not the politics. The European Broadcasting Union (EBU), a group of public media outlets that produces Eurovision, is demanding that Kiev let Samoilova perform. Otherwise, it says, Ukraine faces the threat of exclusion from future contests. Ingrid Deltenre, head of the EBU, wrote to Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman on 23 March to issue the warning. \"No previous host country has prevented an artist performing at the Eurovision Song Contest and the EBU would not like a precedent to be set in 2017,\"  she wrote in the letter leaked to media. \"We consider the current ban of the Russian singer as unacceptable. As a consequence the UAPBC [Ukraine's National Public Broadcasting Company] might be excluded from future events.\" \"We are increasingly frustrated, in fact angry, that this year's competition is being used as a tool in the ongoing confrontation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine,\" Ms Deltenre added. She said that if Kiev didn't lift its ban, \"it would certainly have a very big negative impact on Ukraine's international reputation as a modern, democratic European nation\". The Eurovision song contest will be held in Kiev on 13 May - and we can expect the same kitsch pop-fuelled love-in as usual. But whether Russia's act will take the stage is still unclear. Samoilova has said she is \"not upset\" by Ukraine's decision. The singer told Russia's state-controlled television she did not understand why Ukraine saw \"some kind of threat in a little girl like me\". \"I will keep going,\" she added. \"I somehow think that everything will change.\""}

She was caught when a social worker checked the 83-year-old's bank statements at her Falkirk home. Cameron, of Maybole, South Ayrshire, was ordered to complete 300 hours of unpaid work after admitting the theft.

He said: \"She knows it's a drop in the ocean compared to what was taken. \"This has had a fractious impact on her family.\" After reading social work background reports, Sheriff William Gilchrist said the offence had been committed in the context of Cameron being pressured by her partner. He said: \"That does make a difference, if it's true, and I have to proceed on the basis that it is true, as it's not been rebutted (by the Crown). \"For that reason alone, I will employ the alternative to custody, but it will be the maximum.\""}
{"text": "That is the conclusion of a study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Previous studies had shown that a specific style of grooming - grooming hand clasp (GHC) - was restricted to specific populations of chimpanzees. By studying distinct communities of semi-wild chimps, the team identified different styles of GHC and showed they were learned by social convention. These studies provide insights into how differences in social behaviours in human cultures and populations might have arisen. GHC was first observed in the K(ajabala)-Group of chimpanzees living in the Mahale mountains of Tanzania. During GHC, two chimpanzees raise one arm overhead and clasp each other's hands, whilst grooming one another with their free hand. But not all chimpanzees groom in this way - animals in the nearby Gombe field-site never engage in GHC. Why GHC is not pervasive throughout chimpanzee communities was the key question that Prof Edwin van Leeuwen from the Max Plank Institute for Psycholinguistics, the Netherlands, and his colleagues addressed. Previous studies had shown natural variation in GHC style - including palm-to-palm, wrist-to-wrist and forearm-to-forearm clasping. Prof van Leeuwen posited that a preference for a particular style would be \"a strong indication that this behaviour follows cultural patterns\". The researchers recorded GHC behaviour in four social groups of semi-wild chimpanzees living in the Chimfunshi Wildlife Orphanage Trust (CWOT) in the north west of Zambia. Half of the chimpanzees were wild-born, whilst half were reared in the orphanage. The chimpanzees originated from all over Africa and groups were formed based on their date of arrival at the orphanage. This meant that any differences in behaviour would unlikely be due to genetic or ecological influences. Commenting on the study design Prof Lydia Luncz from the Max Plank Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Germany, told BBC News: \"In recent years, research has shifted from debating the existence of culture in great apes to trying to understand its underlying mechanisms. This study uses one of the rare opportunities to study wild animals in a semi-wild setting.\" Of the four groups studied, two engaged in GHC behaviour - one had a preference for wrist-to-wrist GHC whilst the other preferred palm-to-palm. Whilst not included in the published data, Prof van Leeuwen said: \"Most, if not all, individuals engaged in almost all styles (palm, wrist, forearm, other) at least once. \"This is actually part of our argument against genetic influences: if all individuals/pairs can do everything, but just prefer one style over the other, then genetics are ruled out as an explaining factor.\" Asked why chimpanzees engage in this unusual behaviour, he said: \"There are many hypotheses out there as to why the chimpanzees (and some bonobos) engage in GHC behaviour, one of which is to (re-)establish close social bonds.\" But, just as in human cultures, the behaviour isn't fixed. There is at least one published example of an individual in a non-GHC community who spontaneously started engaging in GHC and, over time, transferred this to other members of the group. Commenting on the new findings, Prof Frans de Waal, director of the Living Links Centre at at Emory University's Yerkes Primate Centre, said: \"This is a very nice study that contributes to the field by looking in more detail at a defined behaviour. \"The idea of chimpanzee 'culture' was originally supported by experimental studies in captivity that show how behaviour can spread by social learning. \"The present study goes beyond this in taking neighbouring communities (where genetics and ecology are the same) and finding substantial differences from group to group. This is an extra argument for social learning.\" According to Prof Luncz, the findings also provide insight into how human social behaviour has evolved: \"In many ways, chimpanzees are very similar to us humans and by studying the similarities to our closest living relatives, we have the unique opportunity to learn more about the evolutionary roots of culture, which is one of the key elements of our identity\"."}

Data from WeatherEnergy showed that sunshine in Edinburgh in April generated more electricity than is used in an average home - a total of 113%. In Aberdeen the figure was 111%, 106% in Glasgow and 104% in Inverness. For homes fitted with solar hot water panels, there was enough sunshine in the cities to cover average usage. WWF Scotland has now called on more home and business owners to make use of the technology. Director Lang Banks said: \"For the tens of thousands of Scottish households that have already installed solar panels, there was enough sun to effectively meet all of their electricity or hot water needs, helping to reduce our reliance on polluting fossil fuels. \"With these sorts of figures, every home or business with a south-facing roof should seriously consider switching on to the full potential of solar power. Similarly, there is no reason why Scotland should not be home to commercial-scale solar farms. \"During the month, Scotland's wind turbines generated enough output to supply the electricity needs of over 1.5 million homes. So, as we approach the period of the year where winds are less powerful, it's great to see the potential of solar to also contribute our energy needs.\" WeatherEnergy's Karen Robinson said: \"Scotland has long been leading the charge when it comes to wind power. However, despite misconceptions, Scotland also has potential for sun-loving renewables too. \"The data clearly shows that there's plenty of sunshine to meet a significant proportion of an average family's electricity and hot water needs for most months of the year. \"With hundreds of thousands of roofs, it would make sense for more Scots to tap the sun's power.\""}

{"text": "They were made by combining pictures from the probe’s high-resolution, “black and white” camera, Lorri, and its lower-resolution, colour imager known as Ralph. The difference in hue between Pluto and Charon is clear. But what catches the eye are four dark spots on the 2,300km-wide dwarf planet. Each spot is about 500km across. Quite why they should be so similar in size and spacing is not clear. Their dominant placing is on the hemisphere that New Horizons will not see during its close flyby on 14 July. However, there should be ample opportunity to study them in the days leading up to the encounter. “It’s a real puzzle - we don’t know what the spots are, and we can’t wait to find out,” said New Horizons principal investigator, Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute. “Also puzzling is the longstanding and dramatic difference in the colours and appearance of Pluto compared to its darker and greyer moon Charon.” If, as scientists think, Pluto and Charon are the products of a collision between two primitive bodies in the early Solar System, one might expect them to look more similar. New Horizon’s flyby data will hopefully provide the answer. The US space agency (Nasa) mission is now closing in on Pluto and its five moons. The moment of closest approach on the 14th will take place at 11:49 GMT, when the probe is just 12,500km above the surface. It is moving too fast - at 13.7km/s - to go into orbit, and it will simply scream past the dwarf and its satellites, gathering as much data as it can. No pictures will be sent back to Earth on the day itself; the spacecraft will be too busy executing its pre-programmed observation campaign. Instead, the first images from the flyby should be presented on the following day, on 15 July. Controllers have decided not to alter the course of the probe. They had been looking for icy debris in the vicinity of Pluto that might pose a collision hazard, but could find nothing obvious. New Horizons was commanded to make a thruster burn earlier this week, to speed it up ever so slightly. This will ensure the spacecraft reaches a precise point in space and time to carry out the pre-programmed observation sequence. The probe must spin around to take pictures of all the different targets, and if its navigation is off by even a small amount it will be looking in the wrong direction at the critical moment. On Thursday, New Horizons was just under 15 million km from Pluto, but 4.7 billion km from Earth. The vast distance to the probe's home world means a radio signal takes about 4.5 hours from sending to receipt. The BBC will be screening a special Sky At Night programme about Pluto on Monday 20 July, which will recap all the big moments from the New Horizons flyby.

It worsened and he was diagnosed with cancer by another doctor in June 2012. Mr Cosgrove, of Market Street, Hatherleigh, sued Dr Al-Doori who practised at Blake House Surgery in Black Torrington, claiming his negligence cost him years of life.

The allegations are being examined by Pakistan's Supreme Court and the verdict is expected within weeks. Russian president Vladimir Putin is notoriously protective of his private life, and until recently very little was known about his two daughters. \"Russian officials treat any media interest in them with utter suspicion,\" says BBC Russian's Famil Ismailov. \"It's left to journalists to test how far they can push and much of the information has never been confirmed by the family.\" In 2015, the youngest daughter, Yekaterina, emerged into the spotlight after it was revealed she was living in Moscow using the name Katerina Tikhonova. Since then Russians have learned from various media reports that she is married to businessman Kirill Shamalov, the son of one of her father's old friends, and that the couple are worth an estimated $2bn through investments in the gas and petrochemicals industries. Now aged 30, she runs publicly-funded projects on 'intellectual development' at Moscow State University.

In 2015 there was speculation that Sumeyye might run for a seat in parliament, but in the event she did not. She currently has a lower profile role with a Turkish women's rights advocacy group. In addition to her campaigning work Sumeyye continues to be an outspoken supporter of her father and his government.

{"text": "Warriors, the defending Pro12 champions, have found momentum hard to come by this term, currently sitting eighth in the league. They also face an uphill battle to make the Champions Cup quarter-finals. Edinburgh are faring rather better, occupying third place in the Pro12 and still in the hunt for the knockout stages of the European Challenge Cup. Scotland's record cap holder and points-scorer Chris Paterson examines how both Scottish clubs have performed this season and looks ahead to what the rest of the season holds for both Glasgow and Edinburgh. After several seasons of steady and sustained progress, Glasgow made the breakthrough last year by clinching the Pro12 title in unforgettable style against Munster. Following that triumph with more of the same was always going to be a tough ask, especially with Warriors being forced to make do without the 20 players who represented their countries at the Rugby World Cup. Gregor Townsend's men could still go on a run to put them right in the mix come the business end of the season, but they have displayed their undoubted class only sporadically so far in this campaign. Back-to-back 1872 Cup losses to Edinburgh and defeat away to Racing 92 in the Champions Cup means Warriors are on a three-game losing streak, and are in danger of seeing their two main targets - defending the Pro12 title and progressing to the knockout stages in Europe - slip away. Paterson, though, thinks the quality within Glasgow's squad means they could yet find find their best form to go on a winning streak, starting with their make-or-break European clash with Northampton on Sunday. \"It's a crucial part of the season,\" Paterson told BBC Scotland. \"The two games against Edinburgh were both very similar. Edinburgh deserved to win both, their defence was outstanding. Two good, high quality games. As a Scotsman it was good to see that combative style of both teams. \"After those three defeats for Glasgow they are rewarded with a trip to Franklins Gardens and Northampton who beat them pretty soundly at Scotstoun. I know that hurt a lot of the guys at Glasgow, the players and the staff. \"But they have put a lot right since that happened, especially up front, in the scrum. Northampton's domestic form hasn't been great but they are a quality team. \"It's a big, big ask for Glasgow but it's this time of year that the pressure comes on and you have to deliver. They've got a quality coaching staff, a quality group of players. We've seen that, we've seen them win silverware and they'll need all their experience in the next two or three weeks.\" After being cast as a mere sideshow in the shadows of Glasgow's success in recent years, Edinburgh now find themselves in a good place. They are just four points behind Pro12 leaders Scarlets in the league table, and victory over Agen on Friday night at Murrayfield will keep them in contention to reach the knockout stage of the Challenge Cup, a competition they reached the final of last season. \"I think quite rightly they have to target the top end of the table,\" Paterson said. \"With a defence like that they are hard to beat. They're in the top four at the moment, and similarly to Glasgow it's a crucial period of the season. They'll want to go into the Six Nations still in that top four. \"They'll want to finish off the two games in Europe with victories. Keeping that momentum going that Edinburgh have found will be really important and it should set them up for a big season finale.\" Edinburgh's style of play has been a source of great debate, with many believing the tactics employed by coach Alan Solomons do not encourage expansive, attacking rugby. \"They're doing what suits them, they're winning,\" says Paterson, who played for Edinburgh between 1999 and 2007 and again from 2008 to 2012. \"It's not great to watch at times but it's effective. Purists look at style but the professional game is ultimately about results. \"Edinburgh have a fantastic defence, a great set piece and that's their strengths. They are continually adding to their attack. Duncan Hodge is in there and you can see the influence he is trying to bring with the shape and they are trying to play, but it takes a lot of work. \"Edinburgh did so well in the European Challenge Cup last year, they're in a good position this year as well. This weekend's game against Agen is crucial. If they can win at home then it sets up a big final fixture against Grenoble.\""}
{"text": "That was Hollywood and a piece of fantasy. This was Glasgow and too much reality. We're in the 36th minute of Celtic's Europa League contest with Molde and it's 1-1. Etzaz Hussain chips a cross to the home team's far post and suddenly it's 6am and we're listening to Sonny & Cher's \"I Got You Babe\". Same lack of concentration in the Celtic defence as before on these nights, the same inability to make a tackle count, the same blind spot to the runners, the same endgame, when Daniel Hestad shows more hunger than the last witless Celtic defender, Tyler Blackett, and almost karate-kicks the ball into Craig Gordon's net. Media playback is not supported on this device As a goal, it was an abomination. Another one. Under Deila, there is a catalogue of such moments in Europe. Wind the play backwards, slow it down and freeze it at the moment when Hussain delivers the ball and you're reminded of all those mishaps against Legia and Maribor, Salzburg and Zagreb, Malmo and Molde the first time round. Nothing changes. There are eight Celtic men in the penalty area and four Molde attackers. When Mohamed Elyounoussi gets the better of Tom Rogic, there are four Celtic men in the six-yard box and one Molde attacker. When Elyounoussi dinks in his cross to the back post, Blackett is goal-side of Hestad and seemingly in a good position to deal with it. With the ball heading into their airspace, Hestad becomes active and Blackett becomes passive. There's only one winner and it's the guy with the heart to get there. The guy in blue. The guy who wants it more. Media playback is not supported on this device As the ball hits the net, there are eight Celtic men in camera shot and three from Molde. Out-numbered more than two-to-one and still they score. Deila always calls it as he sees it. Sometimes the way he sees it is completely wrong. In the aftermath of another sobering failure in the Europa League, the Celtic manager bemoaned the performance of his team. He said that Celtic \"didn't reach the level we are normally at.\" Quite clearly, he was mistaken. They absolutely did reach their level. And this is it. Losing head-wreckingly cheap goals in Europe is their norm now. Failing to win against this type of opposition is the way of things. Nights like Thursday are not the exception at Celtic any more, they're the rule. They've had three shots at the Champions League under Deila and they've flunked all three. Now they have no wins from four in their Europa League group. In their last half-dozen matches in Europe, they have conceded 13 goals. More than two a game. They're going out there with a psychology of having to score three to win a match. At what point does Deila stop kidding himself into thinking that his team are better than they are and accept that this is what they've become? He plaintively suggested that Celtic's qualification hopes are still alive, that they are capable of victories over Ajax in Glasgow and Fenerbahce in Istanbul in the last two rounds in the group. Deila is seeing things that most others can't see. His team have won just two games out of 12 in the Europa League on his watch. They have yet to win away from home in this competition in his time. In their last seven games, they have taken three points from a possible 21, so the notion of six from six in the coming weeks is one he'll find hard to sell. There was something else that Deila said in the wake of the defeat by the sixth-best team in Norway. \"All the time we analyse what we are doing.\" It was a straightforward statement and one you wouldn't normally highlight, if it wasn't for what Deila had said the day before. He said he didn't analyse the previous match with Molde, a 3-1 horror show a few weeks back. He took the DVD, crushed it up and threw it in the garbage. \"That was not Celtic,\" he remarked on Wednesday. The point he was making was that it was worthless watching that error-strewn performance and trying to learn from it because it was so out of character. It was a one-off, a bad day that wouldn't be repeated. Hence, no point wasting time looking at it. \"Some managers would go through it all again, but they are not the best ones, I can assure you,\" he said. The counter argument would be that the \"best ones\" would study the DVD from sun-down to sun-up to figure out what went wrong so that they could put the fixes in place. The \"best ones\" are obsessed about detail and excellent at imparting knowledge to their players in a way that is easy to understand. The \"best ones\" somehow manage to simplify complicated game-plans and make them work. Now that his team have made the same kind of cataclysmic errors as they did in Molde and Malmo, what does Deila do? Declare it another one-off and toss the DVD in the rubbish again? Celtic are not learning and it's painful to watch. They're like a prize-fighter who lands some clean blows but who continually leaves his guard down and then wonders why the hell he's getting knocked out all the time. They do good things in matches, but the wretched things make their lives impossible. Every team that plays this Celtic side knows about its soft underbelly and its propensity to lose the plot. Light can turn to shade very quickly for them. One minute, they're bombing forward and creating things and the next the gaps they've left in pursuit of a goal are plugged by the opposition. And then they're reeling. It's not quite Keystone Cops, but it's not far off. Molde's first goal was a lovely strike by Elyounoussi, but he was given the ball by Blackett and the space by Blackett's team-mates. Their second - and the winner - was about defensive indecisiveness and then defensive absent-mindedness. This keeps happening. In Europe, Celtic are going backwards. The club's hierarchy have things to ponder. Deila is trying to rebuild the side. Some of the Celtic decision-makers will be minded to give him time to get on with it and others will want to see more reason to give him that time. It's there domestically, but not internationally. It was a dank night in the east end of Glasgow. A night that posed many questions. There was one bright shaft and it was Kieran Tierney, a full-back who's backing up performances week on week. He can defend, attack, play a pass and hit a cross. He's got pace and hunger. Sure, he's a raw work-in-progress, but that's OK. He's 18-years-old and still he was Celtic's best player against Molde. Deila singled him out afterwards. KT, he called him. \"A positive thing on a dark day.\" The only positive. Celtic Park used to be a European fortress where even Cristiano Ronaldo's Manchester United, Lionel Messi's Barcelona and Kaka's AC Milan could not avoid defeat. The memories remain vivid, but, really, those days, and that relevance in Europe, are an eternity ago. It was once a hub of excitement, but Celtic Park has become a faded fairground, a tired version of its former self. Those great 'European nights' we talked about? That kind of glamour has gone from the place."}

{"text": "The 23-year-old Scarlets loose-head will win his fourth cap in Dublin, with 119-times capped Jenkins on the bench. He concedes Jenkins and Paul James - who does not make the match day squad - were his idols as a young player. \"It's definitely a big opportunity for me but Gethin and Paul aren't bad boys to fall back on,\" he said. \"If I don't take it, there are two boys behind me, Paul and Gethin, who will.\" Coach Warren Gatland's decision to opt for the youth of Evans against the defending champions hints at long-term planning for the 2019 World Cup. According the the New Zealander, 35-year-old Jenkins is unlikely to be at the tournament and Ospreys loose-head James is only two years younger. Evans, who missed out on selection for the 2015 World Cup, has also impressed the Wales management with his displays for the Scarlets in the Pro12. He said he was delighted with his selection and was full of praise for the senior players. \"I started playing rugby when Gethin and Paul were doing really well,\" he added. \"It was good to watch them and I'm still learning off them today. \"It's awesome really to be picked ahead of a Lion and Paul, who has 60 plus caps, so you can take a lot of of confidence from that. \"They are really tidy people as well.\" And asked if Jenkins had spoken to him following the team announcement, Evans laughed: \"Yes, he just said: 'Your lungs are going to be burning on Sunday'.\""}
{"text": "Welsh ministers aim to increase the role of third sector bodies as council budgets continue to be squeezed. Auditor General Huw Vaughan Thomas's report said it was \"unclear if these aspirations are deliverable\". A Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) spokesman called the third sector a \"key and valued partner\". Mr Thomas's report said the Welsh Government envisaged \"a growing role for the third sector in delivering services,\" but poor arrangements for awarding money \"currently impose heavy burdens on organisations\". Third sector organisations are neither state run, nor part of the private sector and include voluntary organisations, charities and social enterprises. There are about 32,500 different third sector organisations, 230,000 trustees, 1.3 million volunteers and 51,000 employees in Wales. A Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We are currently preparing guidance on good practice in relation to third sector compacts between third sector organisations and local public services. We will look carefully at the recommendations of the report in relation to the guidance.\" With ever tighter budgets, councils across Wales have turned to alternative providers to run services such as leisure and libraries. Mr Thomas said: \"We found that performance management arrangements are too inconsistent to provide an adequate level of assurance that services are working well and resources are being used effectively.\" On Thursday a £1.5m mental health centre developed by charity Hafal will open in Swansea. Local government funding of the third sector rose from £154.1m in 2009-10 to £248.8m in 2013-14. Welsh Government grant funding was £240m in 2013-14 and £208m in 2014-15. Recommendations include clarifying expectations of local authorities and AMs playing a key role in ensuring any gaps or weaknesses are identified and addressed. A WLGA spokesman said the report showed \"more needs to be done to engage earlier and more strategically with third sector organisations in terms of funding decisions and service redesign\". Chairman of the public accounts committee, Nick Ramsay, said a self-evaluation system Mr Thomas included in his report for councils to help make funding decisions would \"go a long way to help address the findings of the review and will strengthen current performance\"."}
{"text": "After a job interview, one of the women was told her \"personal arrangements with the new baby will make it impossible to carry out this role\". Another of the cases was settled by the Irish Football Association (IFA). All three women were helped to pursue their separate claims by The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland. Sarah Shilliday, Cherie White and Kelly McAtamney accepted financial settlements before their cases reached an industrial tribunal. Ms Shilliday said her \"childcare responsibilities\" were discussed when she was interviewed for a management job with RJN Chemicals. She later received an email from the firm that commented favourably on her suitability for the post, but added: \"sadly I'm afraid your personal arrangements with the new baby will make it impossible to carry out this role\". \"I was really upset when I received this email as it clearly indicated that the fact I had a child had influenced the decision not to appoint me,\" she said. \"I could have accepted not getting the job if that was because I wasn't the best candidate, but to have the opportunity denied because I am a mother is not acceptable.\" Ms Shilliday's case was settled for £3,000. The second case was brought against Medi Cosmetics by its former beauty therapist by Kelly McAtamney, who was pregnant and at risk of miscarriage. She alleged the company would not adjust her duties to accommodate her doctor's advice that she needed to \"stay off her feet\" as much as possible. \"They would not allow me to sit down to perform my duties and when, failing that, a request for a period of maternity suspension was also refused, I had no option but to continue on sick leave,\" said Ms McAtamney. \"Subsequently I felt I had to resign.\" She received a £4,500 settlement with no admission of liability. The Irish Football Association (IFA) settled a complaint from Cherie White for £8,000, without admission of liability. Ms White alleged a number of temporary positions, including posts which had arisen while she was on maternity leave, had been made permanent. \"I'd worked for the IFA for a number of years on temporary contracts and I believed that, but for my maternity leave, I would have been in a position to be considered for one of the permanent posts,\" she said. Eileen Lavery, who leads the Equality Commission's advice service, said pregnancy discrimination was a \"persistent problem\" and the most \"common cause of complaint on the grounds of gender\" the watchdog receives."}
{"text": "It looked as though it would be a comfortable win after Rooney and Peter Pawlett gave them the half-time lead. David Wotherspoon pulled a goal back for Saints early in the second half before Niall McGinn and Rooney again stretched the visitors' lead. However, Steven Anderson and Tam Scobbie scored in a late Saints rally. There was to be no late equaliser as Derek McInnes's side extended their run to 12 league games unbeaten, while Tommy Wright's men have now gone eight matches without a victory. An injury to Andy Considine in the warm-up led to Mark Reynolds being promoted from the bench prior to kick-off, which meant the Dons started with the same back four that began the midweek win over Celtic. However, it was the re-jigged Saints defence that was troubled as early as the fifth minute when Cammy Smith's neat pass picked out Shay Logan just inside the box. The full-back delivered a low cross to the back post, where Rooney pounced to slot home his 11th goal in his past 15 appearances. St Johnstone almost got a quick equaliser from a well-worked corner that fell to Scobbie at the edge of the area and the defender's left-foot volley bounced back off Scott Brown's left-hand post. Liam Craig was booked for hauling down Graeme Shinnie as he ran at the Saints defence after breaking up play in the midfield, but that was not the only punishment for the home side. The resultant free-kick was taken by Pawlett and he struck it from 26 yards with the aid of what looked like a slight deflection into the corner of the net. Saints came close just before the interval when Graham Cummins was clean through, but his touch took him wide of goal as well as the goalkeeper and, from an acute angle, his effort crept inches wide of the post. The home side began the second half in positive fashion and only a goal-line clearance from Shinnie prevented Scobbie, with a right-foot lob, pulling a goal back. A goal did materialise for Saints after fine footwork on the edge of the area by Steven MacLean, whose reverse pass found Wotherspoon for a composed finished that breathed hope into the home side. Rooney twice went close before McGinn restored the two-goal lead when Simon Church took advantage of poor defending and set up the substitute for is ninth goal of the season. The home defence were culpable again as Rooney easily shrugged off a couple of challenges to fire his second of the match. However, Anderson out-jumped everyone at the back post to head home Craig's corner and, one minute from the end, Scobbie's shot sailed through a ruck of players."}
{"text": "The veteran actor, whose films include Dracula, The Wicker Man and the Lord of the Rings trilogy, died on Sunday morning at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London, according to reports. The decision to release the news days later was based on his wife's desire to inform family members first. The couple had been married for more than 50 years. Here are some of his career highlights in pictures. \"Initially, I was told I was too tall to be an actor,\" Sir Christopher told Total Film in 2013.  \"I thought, 'Right, I'll show you.'\" After an uncredited debut in Laurence Olivier's film version of Hamlet, he spent 10 years as a bit-part player, before signing a contract with horror studio Hammer. His first film for Hammer was The Curse of Frankenstein, in which he played the monster opposite Peter Cushing as Frankenstein. The duo went on to make more than 20 films together. The actor made his first appearance as a vampire in 1958's Horror of Dracula. He went on to play Dracula nine times - although he disliked being linked with the role in later life. Sir Christopher had no lines in 1965's Dracula: Prince of Darkness. A popular myth suggests the written dialogue was so bad that the star chose to hiss instead of saying his lines. However, internal memos showed his agreement to record a TV trailer for the production - which also had extremely poor lines - suggesting that the decision to play the part silent had been taken by the director. Sir Christopher's first two Dracula films were banned in Australia, but the third - Dracula Has Risen From The Grave - passed after receiving several cuts. It ran for a three-week season at Sydney's Capitol theatre in January 1970. But the star was not restricted to vampirical roles, playing the title character in 1966's Rasputin, the Mad Monk. Hammer was very nervous of the film, aware that MGM had been sued in 1933 by Princess Irina Romanoff Yusupov, who claimed a previous film about Rasputin had invaded her privacy by erroneously portraying her as his mistress. As such, the Hammer film came with the disclaimer: \"This is an entertainment, not a documentary. No attempt has been made at historical accuracy... all the characters and incidents may be regarded as fictitious.\" The actor also starred as the criminal fiend Fu Manchu in a series of 1960s films, starting with The Face of Fu Manchu. A distant cousin and golfing partner of James Bond creator Ian Fleming, Sir Christopher was in the frame to play Doctor No in the first Bond movie. Joseph Wiseman eventually won the part, but Sir Christopher later appeared opposite Roger Moore's 007 in 1974's The Man With The Golden Gun. Cult thriller The Wicker Man, about pagan worshipers on a remote Scottish island, was the actor's personal favourite from his filmography - although he disliked the cut released to cinemas in 1973. \"It was shown in a butchered form,\" he said. \"Even the DVD is butchered. What happened to that film, I still don't know. The negative disappeared from that day to this.\" A restored version, reinstating most of the original footage, was released in 2013. In a career essaying villains, possibly his most comedic turn came in Gremlins 2 - where he played the unfortunately named Doctor Catheter. Director Joe Dante said: \"The idea of the Christopher Lee character being a geneticist came in because [special effects artist] Rick Baker didn't want to do the movie unless he could design new gremlins. So how are we going to get new gremlins? Well, we'll have a character who can create them, this mad-scientist geneticist.\" In the 21st Century, the actor appeared as Saruman in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy and in the director's two Hobbit films, as well as playing Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. \"This last decade has been the most extraordinary decade of my life,\" he said in a 2012 interview. Knighted in 2009, Sir Christopher was given the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) fellowship in 2011. He was presented with the award by Tim Burton, with whom he made four films: Sleepy Hollow, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Sweeney Todd and Dark Shadows (he also narrated the poem that became The Nightmare Before Christmas). Accepting the award, he said: \"There was a newspaper this morning that said I was going to cry - something I don't often do, in films at any rate. \"But it's a very emotional moment for me. I'm thankful that I don't follow in the steps of the great Stanley Kubrick, whose award was posthumous.\" Still active into his 90s, he recorded several heavy metal albums and, in 2012, attended the premiere of James Bond film Skyfall, along with his wife, Brigit. He said the secret to having a 50-year marriage was simple. \"Marry someone wonderful.\""}

{"text": "The Star Wars director is executive producer whilst Interstellar co-writer Jonathan Nolan will pen the scripts Sir Anthony Hopkins, Thandie Newton, Evan Rachel Wood, Ed Harris and James Marsden will all star. The show is a remake of a 1973 sci-fi western about a futuristic themed amusement park that has a robot malfunction. HBO teased fans with a six second Vine clip and a cryptic, mathematical Tweet but there's no word on how many episodes will be made. The studio is calling the series, which will debut in 2015, \"a dark odyssey about the dawn of artificial consciousness and the future of sin\".

{"text": "Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said up to 70,000 might be heading to the border, while a monitoring group put the number at about 40,000. Intense Russian air strikes have helped Syria's government troops make advances near the country's largest city. Meanwhile, Russia accused Turkey of preparing an invasion into Syria. Also on Thursday, a Saudi military spokesman said the country was ready to send ground troops to Syria to fight the so-called Islamic State group. Any decision would have to be accepted by leaders of the US-led coalition during a meeting in Brussels next month, Saudi Brig Gen Ahmad Bin-Hasan al-Asiri told the Associated Press news agency. The offer was welcomed by US Defence Secretary Ash Carter, who said that he would discuss the issue with the Saudi defence minister in Brussels next week. In other developments: Talks break down - but who's to blame? Speaking at the donor conference in London, Mr Davutoglu said: \"Now 10,000 new refugees are waiting in front of the door of Kilis (Turkey's border town) because of air bombardment and attacks against Aleppo.\" He added that 60,000-70,000 people \"in the camps in north Aleppo are moving towards Turkey\". The Observatory put the number at about 40,000. However, a BBC correspondent at the Kilis border crossing on Friday said there was no indication yet of large numbers of refugees on either side of the crossing. Mark Lowen said that were reports however that 2,000 Syrian refugees were either waiting out of sight or had moved elsewhere. In a related development, Turkey said it had activated an emergency protocol allowing for the rapid processing of refugees. A similar protocol was enacted during the siege of Kobane last year when around 200,000 refugees crossed the border. Mr Davutoglu also condemned Russia's involvement in Syria, saying that both Moscow and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad were guilty of war crimes. Both Moscow and Damascus have repeatedly rejected such accusations. Turkey is clearly incensed by the extent of the military support Russia is giving its ally - the government forces of President Assad, the BBC World Service's Middle East editor Alan Johnston says. Russia's defence ministry said that since 1 February it had hit 875 \"terrorist objects in the Aleppo, Latakia, Homs, Hama and Deir ez-Zor provinces\". This helped the Syrian army to cut the main rebel supply from the Turkish border to Aleppo, according to reports. Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia's strikes against opposition forces were \"undermining efforts to find a political solution to this conflict\". The rebel siege of the towns of Nubul and Zahraa, northern Aleppo province, has now been broken, the government in Damascus said. Separately, Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Moscow \"has reasonable grounds to suspect intensive preparation of Turkey for a military invasion\" into Syria. He added that Russia had already presented \"incontrovertible video evidence\" which reportedly showed Turkish shelling of Syria. Ankara has not publicly commented on the claim. The Middle Eastern press carries some positive comment on the outcome of the Syria donors' conference in London. However, they also say that it shows the Syrian crisis is expected to last for a long time and needs a political solution. Kuwait's Al-Qabas praises the \"generous assistance\" pledged, but highlights the Kuwaiti emir's remarks that \"the humanitarian tragedy will not end until a political solution that puts an end to bloodshed is found.\" An editorial in Qatar's Al-Rayah says what's needed is not just support for the Syrian people, but rescuing them from what it terms the \"systematic genocide committed by the regime, and the countries and sectarian militias that support it.\" Tensions between Turkey and Russia have escalated since Turkish fighter jets shot down a Russian bomber last November. Ankara said it acted after the aircraft violated Turkey's air space - but Russia insisted the plane was shot down over Syria. More than 250,000 people have died in almost five years of war in Syria. Eleven million others have fled their homes as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and those opposed to his rule battle each other, as well as IS jihadists. Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-government protests developed into a civil war that, four years on, has ground to a stalemate, with the Assad government, the so-called Islamic State group, an array of Syrian rebels and Kurdish fighters all holding territory. Who is fighting whom? Government forces concentrated in Damascus and the centre and west of Syria are fighting the jihadists of Islamic State and al-Nusra Front, as well as less numerous so-called \"moderate\" rebel groups, who are strongest in the north and east. These groups are also battling each other. How has the world reacted? Iran, Russia and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement are propping up the Alawite-led Assad government, while Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar back the more moderate Sunni-dominated opposition, along with the US, UK and France. Hezbollah and Iran are believed to have troops and officers on the ground, while a Western-led coalition and Russia are carrying out air strikes."}
{"text": "George Cheese, 18, had been employed at the German company's Reading garage for six months when he was found hanged on 9 April 2015. The \"horseplay\", which also included being hosed down and put in a car boot, contributed to his depression, said Coroner Peter Bedford. He recorded a narrative verdict. Mr Bedford said Mr Cheese had also been affected by a relationship breakdown and medical discharge from the Army. Reading Coroner's Court heard on Thursday that his body was found in woodland near his home in Woodley, Berkshire. He had been prescribed medication for depression, which he had not been taking, \"brought on by a series of life events\", Mr Bedford said. He also wrongly believed he had a serious illness and had researched cancer symptoms online. The inquest heard that after leaving the Army due to fracturing both of his legs in 2014, Mr Cheese was happy at securing his \"dream job\" at Audi. However, his parents Keith and Purdy Cheese told the inquest their son had come home with minor burns after his trousers were doused with flammable brake fluid and ignited. He had also said he was placed in a bin, locked in a cage, put in a car boot, hosed down with water and given \"dead legs\" by colleagues during separate incidents. His manager Terry Kindeleit said the \"physical incidents\", some of which he described as \"horseplay\", stopped after he warned staff. The court heard that Mr Cheese had referred to the behaviour as \"banter\" that \"sometimes goes too far\". Mr Cheese's family asked for neglect from Audi to form part of the coroner's conclusion but Mr Bedford said the legal requirement for this had not been met. He said, however, that Mr Cheese's death had been a \"wake-up call\" for Audi and was in \"no doubt\" that action had been taken to prevent the same thing happening again. Thames Valley Police said the incidents at Audi had been investigated and there was insufficient evidence for prosecution."}
{"text": "Opposition leader Agathon Rwasa won 19% of the vote after his name was left on the ballot paper, despite a boycott. At least 70 people have been killed since Mr Nkurunziza announced in April he would run for a third term. The government accuses the opposition of provoking violent protests. Opponents says his bid was illegal, due to a limit of two terms in the constitution. Final, official results are expected at the end of next week. Turnout was more than 73%, higher than many analysts predicted, although it was significantly lower in the capital Bujumbura, where most of the protests have been. In an interview with the BBC after the declaration, Mr Rwasa described the elections results as \"a joke\". \"These are results set up in the electoral commission... not those expressed by the voters,\" he said. Regional and international bodies have already said the conditions for credible and free elections were not met. The US State Department has joined critics saying the election lacks credibility. Who is Pierre Nkurunziza? Profile: Pierre Nkurunziza Why Burundi poll matters \"Ten years of dictatorship is too much\", Mr Rwasa told the BBC, citing alleged corruption and extrajudicial killings as reasons why many Burundians now want change. Mr Rwasa would not confirm whether he or other members of his opposition coalition Amizero y'Abarundi would be taking up the 30 seats they had been awarded in the parliamentary election, despite boycotting the vote. The African Union (AU) did not send observers - the first time it has taken such a stance against a member state. The US state department and the European Union expressed concern that the elections were not free and fair. In May, army generals opposed to President Nkurunziza's continuing rule failed to overthrow him in a coup attempt. Tensions between Burundi's ethnic Hutu majority - comprising some 85% of the 10.5 million population - and Tutsi minority have flared up regularly since independence from Belgium in 1962. Mr Nkurunziza led a Hutu rebel group fighting the Tutsi-dominated army until a peace deal led to him becoming president in 2005. The Constitutional Court backed his argument that his first term in office did not count towards the two-term limit, as he was elected by MPs."}

The opposition FDU-Inkingi, whose leader Victoire Ingabire is in jail, did not take part in the election, as it is not officially registered. Two other parties regarded as close to the RPF took 13% and 9% of the vote. Voting took placed days after two people were killed in two grenade attacks in the capital, Kigali. No group has said it carried out the attacks but officials have blamed the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which is accused of links to the 1994 genocide, and critics of the government recently exiled in South Africa. The Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) government has been praised for maintaining stability and overseeing rapid economic growth since the slaughter of some 800,000 minority ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. But President Kagame has been increasingly accused of ignoring human rights and stamping out any opposition. The RPF has kept its parliamentary majority but lost two seats. A third opposition party to contest in the election, PS-Imberakuri, did not win any seats. Its officials told the BBC that their supporters were harassed during the campaign - charges rejected by the RPF. Helped by quotas, Rwanda has been the world's only parliament where women form a majority. The parliament has 80 seats, 24 of which are reserved for women, two for candidates representing the youth and one representing disabled people. Women's groups were electing the female MPs on Tuesday; the other quota MPs will be selected on Wednesday."}

All roads in the centre were closed to traffic and drivers were asked to avoid the area. Firefighters left the scene at 16:45 BST and the cause is believed to be accidental. No injuries were reported. Ian Williams from the fire service said the blaze started on the ground floor and quickly spread to the upper floors. Llangefni councillor Bob Parry said there were concerns about smoke affecting other businesses in the street. He added: \"It's right in the centre of the town and to have something like that, well, it could be an eyesore for a time.\" Keith Thomas, who owns J Thomas & Sons butchers next door to the chip shop, said it had been badly damaged. \"The fish and chip shop is gutted,\" he said. \"There's been so much smoke we can't really tell about damage at my shop.\" Andrew Hughes, owner of Tlysau engraving shop, said: \"The shop went up in flames, there's nothing left of it. \"I saw the windows blow out.

{"text": "Only one team will be promoted from Division Two this summer to reduce the number of top-tier teams in 2017. A top division of eight teams will be introduced, down from nine, with 10 counties in the second. \"It makes things more difficult in the short term,\" Morris said. \"But we've got a slightly stronger squad this year, we've certainly got a slightly deeper squad, and we've got a very motivated squad. \"We've got the balance that can certainly challenge to go up. \"It's not going to be easy, it never is, it's going to be slightly more difficult this year. \"But we want to keep up the momentum we started with at the beginning of last year.\" Media playback is not supported on this device Glamorgan finished fourth in Division Two in 2015 after being second for part of the campaign. Despite winning four matches in a row they failed to add to their victories in the latter part of the season. Former England spin bowler Robert Croft has replaced Toby Radford as Glamorgan's head coach ahead of the new County season, which starts at home to Leicestershire on 17 April. They have signed Netherlands fast bowler Timm van der Gugten and young Australian batsman Nick Selman, as well as converting all-rounder Craig Meschede's loan spell into a three-year contract. Morris is confident Glamorgan can be part of any future city-based Twenty20 league, designed to copy the success of Australia's Big Bash. The counties have voted to continue with a north-south split and an 18-team competition for the time being, But Morris says the county will be part of continuing discussions with the ECB over the next 12 months. The former England batsman hopes that Cardiff's SSE Swalec Stadium will host matches even if the number of teams competing is reduced. \"We're very fortunate we have got a great stadium,\" he said at the launch of a new BTEC Sport Studies qualification in conjunction with Fitzalan High School in Cardiff. \"Cardiff is one of the sporting capitals of the UK, we're using to holding major events and major teams here. \"Any potential changes that are going to happen, we feel we'll be able to respond to really positively.\""}

{"text": "\"The UK for now is not even the preferred destination for Romanians,\" said spokeswoman Brandusa Predescu. Some British newspapers have predicted migrants will make the journey to claim benefits and even steal scrap metal. Ministers have refused to predict how many migrants from Romania and Bulgaria might arrive. Both countries joined the EU in 2007 but since then, their citizens have been able to work in the UK only under certain conditions, which come to an end on Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Sun newspaper claimed the first coachload of migrants had boarded a bus bound for the UK, with some of them intent on begging for a living or living off the state. Ms Predescu told the BBC some of the media coverage had bordered on racist and there had been an \"outright campaign\" against Romanians and Bulgarians. \"There isn't going to be an invasion of Romanians as of two days' time. Not all Romanians, young and old, are going to get on a plane. \"We don't have estimates, you don't have estimates. The UK will [not be] and is not the preferred destination of Romanians.\" The Labour government vastly underestimated the number of people who would come to the UK after eight nations joined the European Union in 2004. It used a prediction of 13,000 arrivals - a figure which was exceeded many times over with a peak net migration figure, from the EU and elsewhere, of 252,000 in 2010. This time, with eight other EU countries - including France, Germany and Spain - lifting restrictions at the same time, ministers say forecasting numbers is difficult. Campaigners for tighter laws have said 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians a year for the first five years could come to the UK. The Bulgarian ambassador has previously estimated that about 8,000 migrants a year from Bulgaria could come to the UK. Professor John Salt of the migration research unit at University College London said that data from Bulgaria shows that for the first three months of 2014, the number of advance airline bookings is down on the same period last year. But he conceded there was a risk that services in the South East could be put under pressure if large numbers arrive. The leader of Westminster Council, Philippa Roe, echoed this concern and said Roma people had caused disruption in central London by aggressively begging and pickpocketing. The government is tightening the rules from 1 January to ensure that migrants cannot claim out-of-work benefits for three months after arriving and will only qualify for support after six months if they had a genuine chance of employment. Overseas visitors and migrants are also to face new charges for some NHS services in England."}

{"text": "In some ways the opposition leader, who is in a neck-and-neck race with incumbent Ma Ying-jeou, has already done so. The 55-year-old former law professor has been credited with cleaning up the image of her Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in recent years. Campaigning in the southern city of Tainan, she pledged to engage Mr Ma's Kuomintang (KMT) and other opponents in policy making, if elected. Cruising down the streets in a jeep, she was greeted by supporters chanting her nickname, ''Little Ing''. She has strong support in the island's south, including the cities of Kaohsiung and Chaiyi. ''We will meet the people's expectations for political tolerance, understanding and cooperation,'' she said. Her pragmatic approach and analytical style is a marked departure from the often fiery rhetoric of her predecessor, Chen Shui-bian. Ms Tsai joined the DPP in 2004 but rose quickly to become its chairwoman four years later, when the party suffered a heavy defeat in the presidential elections. Mr Chen lost to Mr Ma at the polls, and was later jailed for corruption. Despite splits and factionalism in the party, Ms Tsai was able to rally the support she needed to rejuvenate the DPP. Under her leadership, it has performed much better in local elections. On policy matters, Ms Tsai has criticised the pro-China stance of Mr Ma, opposing the landmark free trade agreement signed between Beijing and Taipei under his rule. Her party favours Taiwan's formal independence from China, which claims Taiwan as a province. During his term as president, Mr Chen angered China with his declarations that Taiwan was ''an independent nation''. Ms Tsai says she is not against negotiating with China on economic and other matters, as long as it does not affect Taiwan's sovereignty. She has also often cast cross-straits relations as a bigger, global discussion, rather than one of bilateral relations. This represents a more moderate position than the party's previous stance on the hot-button issue. However, the Chinese remain suspicious of her and the DPP, and favour Mr Ma. A law graduate of the National Taiwan University, she said recently that she believed relations with China would ''move forward, not backward'' if she were to be elected. Ms Tsai, who is single, completed her master's degree at Cornell University Law School in 1980 and went on to earn a doctorate degree from the London School of Economics and Political Science in 1984. Her style and bearing sets her apart from the rest of the DPP ''old guard'', something that has worked to her advantage in attracting younger voters. Born in a coastal village in the south of Taiwan, she moved to Taipei when she was 11. Her mixed ethnicity - Hakka father and Taiwanese mother - has been cited as one of the traits that helped her connect to supporters. She also has a grandmother who is from one of the non-Chinese indigenous groups in Taiwan. In the 1990s, she was a negotiator for Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization. She was then asked to serve on the National Security Council as an advisor to former President Lee Teng-hui. During the DPP administration from 2000 to 2008, she served as minister of the China policy body, the Mainland Affairs Council, and vice premier. China, she said in an interview with the BBC in June 2011, needs to acknowledge ''the new leadership'' in ''a more sophisticated DPP''. ''Whatever is in the past, is in the past,'' she said. ''I think China will have to look at the matter from a fresh perspective and a new perspective.''"}

Chelmsford Crown Court was told the attack was so forceful that the knife used was left badly bent. Prosecutor Peter Gair said: \"We say her life was taken by this man during a sustained and brutal attack with a knife. She suffered 80 knife wounds to her body. \"That attack was as a direct result of her telling the defendant that their relationship was over. \"Whether it was motivated by jealousy or anger of a mixture of both and other emotions, he exacted a terrible revenge on her which caused her to die at the scene.\" On the night of her death, Miss Davies had cooked a meal for them both at the flat they shared at the sanctuary, the jury heard. Mr Gair added she had decided earlier that day to end the relationship but to let Mr Taylor continue to live at the flat as she did not want to make him homeless. Police later found plates of uneaten food on the kitchen table, suggesting events had escalated quickly. The prosecution told jurors that Taylor initially attacked her in the flat. She fled outside in her pyjamas but he chased after her and killed her in an area known as the Wishing Well before dragging her body to some nearby bushes, Mr Gair added. Pathologist Benjamin Swift said a post-mortem examination found she had suffered at least 80 stab wounds. There were also signs she had been struck all over her body. \"She suffered defensive wounds, suggesting she had been fighting for her life,\" Mr Gair said. Witness Bruce Sequin arrived at the sanctuary to see a man holding a knife standing over a woman's body and making downward stabbing motions. He raised the alarm and when police arrived they found Taylor covered in blood. Officers rushed to help Miss Davies and she gasped 'help\" before losing the strength to speak, Mr Gair said. In the months before the killing, friends had become concerned about the couple's relationship, the court heard. Mr Gair said: \"You will hear evidence that he would take umbrage at her working with other young men and displayed a controlling nature, telling her for example what she could and could not wear.\" The trial continues."}
